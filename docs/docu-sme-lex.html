Introduction
============

File structure
==============

The file format is documented in the Xerox manuals, especially in
[Karttunen 1993 Finite-State Lexicon
Compiler](http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/fssoft/docs/lexc-93/lexc93.html),
but see also the [Beesley and Karttunen book](http://www.fsmbook.com).
The file itself consists of a section defining **Multichar\_symbols**,
and of a large number of lexica, 183 lexica according to the present
count (19.10.01). The file sme-lex.txt contains a.o. the continuation
lexica for nouns, verbs and adjectives, whereas the bulk of the lexicon
is divided into different files, as indicated below.

In the sme-lex.txt file, the **Multichar\_Symbols** section contains all
grammatical tags, and all multicharacter members of the alphabet (the
latter set is taken from the grammar file).

The **Root** lexicon points to the lexica of the different parts of
speech: (for each sublexicon there is a pointer to the relevant file
containing the sublexicon)

The different part of speech lexica are documented here, in the order
just given.

Nouns
=====

The NounRoot lexicon
--------------------

### The structure of the noun-sme.txt file

The file contains the following sections:

1.  LEXICON GuessNoun
2.  LEXICON NounRoot
    1.  Stray forms
    2.  Compounds
    3.  Multiword nouns
    4.  The noun stems themselves, sorted alphabetically (the
        alphabetical sorting is according to the computer algorithm, and
        not according to the Saami one)

The GuessNoun lexiconbelongs to the guess-sme binary file. The idea
behind this is to have a binary file that guesses the grammatical form
of nouns on the basis of their suffix, a hypothetical form like
*plineraiguin* could for example be hypothetised to be the Comitative
Plural of *plinera*. The guesser has not been used, and it is unclear
whether it works at all. TODO: Check this.

The lexicon NounRoot first has some temporary sections. There is a set
"compounds, awaiting a solution on the shorting question", such like
sámegiel, oar, beal, etc., reduced first- and middlepart compounds. The
long-term solution is to build a syllable shortener for these compounds,
for the time being the lexicalised ones are listed here. This section
also contain some loanwords that typically have a shorter, non-sámi form
as compounds, and a longer, Saami form when used as independent word. An
illustrative example is the word *sosial*. In isolation, we find
sosiála, but as compound, we find *sosialdepartemeantta*, etc. Thus,
these words are listed here, pointing directly to the compound lexicon
R.

Finally, the noun stem section itself is the large one, it contains
about 26500 nouns, they are divided into different noun stem classes.
They are documented in the next section.

The ProperNoun lexicon
======================

The proper nouns are stored in `gt/sme/src/propernoun-sme-lex.txt`.

The file structure
------------------

**Propernoun** is one file, with the inflectional lexica first, followed
by the over 36000 items long proper noun lexicon. This lexicon points to
several sublexica. They are shown below, ordered according to the
phonological and semantical properties of the stem. After the table
comes a list of lexica not yet integrated in the table.

This table is still not completed. The lexica are there, but they are
not all properly characterised.

Looking at the distribution, and ignoring the semantic subtags, we have
a (slightly outdated) distribution of names over lexicon types as
follows:

### Saami geographical names

Saami names have been added from Norway, in 2002. Since that, Statens
Kartverk has translated most (all?) Saami names from the old
Bergsland/Ruong to the new 1979 orthography. Now, the remaining Sámi
names should be added to the list, in the following way:

1.  All North Saami names should be extracted from the map base and run
    against the transducer
2.  The names that do not get a +Prop tag should be extracted, and then
    added to the base.

Saami names from Finland and Sweden have not been added, but they are
underway.

Saami names from outside Sápmi, as listed in *Sámi Atlas* are added.
Other Saami names from outside Sápmi should also be added, but we don't
know of good sources for such names (language councils are one
possibility)

Names in other Saami languages are increasingly being used in North
Saami texts, e.g. when referring to South Saami or Lule Saami
institutions. These ones should be added and organised in lexica.

Adjectives

### Comments to the verb sublexica

Within each of the main groups, there are FIVE types, impersonal verbs,
verbs with and without personal passives, verbs without Personal Passive
but with Acc obj (+ two more lexicas, see above The VerbRoot lexicon),
and inherent passives. The difference between *i/a/u* and *e/á/o* verbs
is handeled in the rules file, and not in the lexicon file.

The with / without Personal Passive distinction shows up in one
sublexicon. DOHPPE has PASSIVE, where GILLE has SG3PASS. So, this is
(probably) a transivity difference, cf. also *diehtit* vs. *boahtit*. It
seems thus that the difference is one of transitivity: 0, 1 and 2
valence.

At present, the file *verb-sme-lex.txt* comtains all the verbs. In the
beginning of the file, all sublexica are exemplified. Then follows the
bulk of the verbs, twosyllabic even, manysyllabic even, odd and
contracted verbs.

Pronouns
========

The tag system follows the outline in Nickel.

All Pronouns have the initial lexicon path Root -&gt; Pronoun -&gt; ...

Personal pronouns
-----------------

Lexicon path:

    Personal
     firstperspron
      firstperspronsg -> wordforms -> K
      firstpersprondu -> wordforms -> K
      perspronpl -> wordforms -> K
     nonfirstperspron
      nonfirsperspronsg -> wordforms -> K
      nonfirstpersrondu -> wordforms -> K
      perspronpl -> wordforms -> K

Note that 3rd person is identical for all three persons. Not all forms
were different for the sg and du forms, but the lexica were split for
consistency.

Interrogative pronouns
----------------------

Mii, Gii, Guhte, Guhtemuš, Makkár, MAn Láhkái. The sublexicon
Interrogative contains one entry for Sg Nom, and points the rest to the
case paradigms.

    Interrogative +Sg+Nom -> K (one entry for gii and one for mii)
            oblintercas (one entry for gii and one for mii) demcas

Demonstrative pronouns
----------------------

The lexicon path:

    Demonstrative
     demcas (one entry for each stem)
      demcassg
       nomdemcassg -> wordforms -> K
       obldemcassg -> wordforms -> K
      demcaspl
       nomdemcaspl -> wordforms -> K
       obldemcaspl -> wordforms -> K

Reflexive pronouns
------------------

The Nominative forms are just listed. The oblique ones are directed to
the sublexicon reflobl, and there directed via different case stems to
appropriate Px sublexica. These sublexica are the same as the ones for
nouns, they are found in the sme-lex.txt file. The only exception are
some sublexica that are used only for plural forms, these are duplicated
here from the sme-lex file, in order not to revise the main lexicon.

Reciprocal pronouns
-------------------

The section on reciprocal pronouns consists of three parts. The first 6
entries handle the first element of the recipr. The next 12 handle the
2nd part of the non-Px recipr. Finally, the members of the third section
point to special Px sublexica, designed for the reciprocal pronouns, and
found in the same section.

Relative pronouns
-----------------

Formally, the relative and interrogative pronouns are identical. In this
parser, we skip the separate chapter on relative pronouns, and instead
we use the interrogative pronouns.

Indefinite pronouns
-------------------

We divide the indefinite pronouns into three groups, with a fourth group
of leftovers waiting for a better destiny:

1.  Declineable indefinite pronouns with case + clitic (*mihkkege,
    giige, guhtemušge*)
2.  Declineable indefinites with normal case paradigms (*eará, eanas,
    muhtin*)
3.  Indeclineable indefinites (*buot, eatnat, guhtet*)
4.  TODO: A set of ideosyncratic cases

### Declineable indefinite pronouns with case + clitic

These pronouns have two stems, one nominative, and one oblique, and the
clitic *-ge* attached to the case ending. The initial lexicon splits
them in two, one hard-coded nominative (e.g. *giige*), and one oblique
stem (e.g. *gea-*). Then, the case + clitic sequence is treated as a
single suffix (e.g. locative *-sge*, etc.). Since the clitic slot has
already been filled, they are directed to `#` rather than to `K`.

### Declineable indefinites with normal case paradigms

This section hosts a seemingly complicated system of taylored sublexica.
It contains three sections: First a section where the pronouns
themselved are split into different continuation lexica, then a section
with intoermadiate lexica, and finally a section with the case suffixes
themselves. The lexica are partly modelled upon nominal lexica.

Naming convention for the sublexica:

-   **-c, -v:**  
    Consonant stem, vowel stem

<!-- -->

-   **-n, -ne:**  
    nominative, nominative and essive

### Indeclineable indefinites

There is first a list of multiword indefinites. These are picked out by
the preprocessor and copied onto a file abbr.txt and put in the bin/
catalogue. In thie closed-sme-lex.txt they behave like the other
indeclineable indefinites.

### The ideosyncratic rest category

Indefinite pronouns are complex, and the grammars are not always
explicit enough, so this section hosts a set of pronouns, partly with a
hard-coded tag, partly just commented out. They are awaiting a
principled linguistic solution, but in order to do that, we need more
info than we can get from the reference grammars.

TODO: Have a linguistic/native speaker-look at this section.

Numerals
========

Overview of the lexicon structure
---------------------------------

The numeral lexica are formed as a generator, generating all possible
numerals. The basic lexicon is `Numeral`, and it looks like this:

    LEXICON Numeral
    MILJON ; ! a noun of its own
    UNDERDUHAT ; ! for generator under 1000
    JUSTDUHAT ; ! going via 1000
    OVERDUHAT ; ! for generator over 1000
    OLD ; ! for "thirteen hundred, etc.
    !num-basic ; ! replaced by the 5 lexica above
    !num-derived ; ! still unimplemented
    num-imprecise ;! still almost unimplemented
    ARABIC ; ! for the arabic numerals
    ROMAN ; ! for the roman numerals

MILJON is a noun. OLD is the old way of counting. num-ordinal act like
adjectives, they are not finished yet. ARABIC and ROMAN contain number
generators.

So, what is the reason for the three different lexica around 1000?

The reason is that the numeric system turns at the thousand mark.
Numbers above it and numbers below it behave in the same way, thus we
have both *twentyfour* and *twentyfourthousand*, etc.

The path is OVERDUHAT -&gt; JUSTDUHAT -&gt; UNDERDUHAT. OVERDUHAT
generates the part of the numeral that is over 1000, and all these
lexica then point to JUSTDUHAT. That lexicon has an optional "(one)
thousand" before it leads either to DUHAT and via the relevant case
paradigm to K, or to UNDERDUHAT. UNDERDUHAT contains the numerals 1-999.
UNDERDUHAT starts with the lexicon for one, and gives each group of
numerals its own lexicon.

Cardinals and ordinals
----------------------

The cardinal and ordinal numbers are split at the final lexica, the
`OKTAF` and `2TO9F` lexica. This generates both numbers as second and
fiftysecond.

Indeclinable words
==================

All the lexica for indeclinable words are made the same way:

    LEXICON Root
    Adverb ;
     LEXICON Adverb
     áđamusat adv ;
      LEXICON adv
      +Adv:0 K ;

The Root lexicon points to the POS lexica (Adverb etc.). Each of the POS
lexica lists the entries, with a pointer to an arbitrarily named
sublexicon (here "adv"). This sublexicon contains the grammatical tag
for the POS in question (the tag has no surface form, hence ":0"), and
eventually a pointer towards the cliticon lexicon K. Adverbs can have
clitics added, hence K, whereas subjunctions do not, hence no K.

\[XXX At the moment particles are not directed to K, perhaps they should
be. TODO: Check with corpus and native speakers.\]

Adverbs
-------

They are explained in the intro to the section "Indeclinable words"
above.

Particles
---------

These are in the closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +Pcle and
th\|qeir lexicon path is:

Root -&gt; Particle -&gt; pcle -&gt; \#

Subjunctions
------------

Subjunctions are *ahte, juos*, etc. These are in the closed-sme-lex.txt
file. Their lexicon path is:

Root -&gt; Subjunction -&gt; -&gt; \#

Conjunctions
------------

Conjunctions are *ja, dahjege*, etc. These are in the closed-sme-lex.txt
file. Their tag is +CC and their lexicon path is:

Root -&gt; Conjunction -&gt; Cc -&gt; \#

P-positions
-----------

There are three different classes here: Postpositions, occuring after
their complement, prepositions, occuring before, and adpositions,
occuring both before and after. This could have been done the Lingsoft
way as well: Having +Adp as a common tag for both, and eventually +Prep
and +Postp as subtags, no subtag would indicate both ways (or both
subtags could be used). At the moment, they are left as 3 distinct
groups. The classification is based upon Nickel, p-positions found only
in Sammallahti's dictionary and not in Nickel were put in the Adposition
group. Empirical studies will probably lead to rearrangement of the
present division, this should be looked into in connection with the
morphological disambiguator (cg grammar).

### Adpositions

Adpositions are are *bajil, birra, gaskal*, etc. These are in the
pp-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +Adp and their lexicon path is:

Root -&gt; Adposition -&gt; Pp -&gt; \#

### Postpositions

Postpositions are are *bokte, lusa*, etc. These are in the
pp-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +Po and their lexicon path is:

Root -&gt; Postposition -&gt; Postp -&gt; \#

### Prepositions

Prepositions are are *aisttan, earet*, etc. These are in the
pp-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +Pr and their lexicon path is:

Root -&gt; Preposition -&gt; Prep -&gt; \#

Interjections
-------------

Interjections are are *hoi, huh, kyš-kyš*, etc. These are in the
closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +Interj and their lexicon path is:

Root -&gt; Interjection -&gt; Ij -&gt; \#

Abbreviations
=============

There is a file called abbr-sme-lex.txt.
