# speller-regressions.txt
# This file contains example pairs of known speller bugs. It follows the
# same pattern as the src/typos.txt files, ie error and correction separated
# by a <tab> character:
# error<tab>correction
# Furthermore, this file contains correct entries that should be accepted
# as is - their format is:
# correct<tab>
# ie the correct word followed by a <tab> char, followed by new-line.
#
# The file should be extended with examples of all known bugs we have fixed,
# and can be used to ensure that we don't brake any old fixes in new releases.
# Also problematic patterns not yet properly handled should get test pairs here.
#
# It is possible, and encouraged, to add a comment with the relevant bug ID
# after each (group of) test case. Comments start with <tab>! or <tab>#.
#
# Format summary:
