# hyph-regressions.txt
# This file contains example pairs of known hyphenation bugs. It follows the
# same pattern as the regressions.txt files, ie error and correct pattern
# separated by a <tab> character:
# error<tab>correct
#
# The file should be extended with examples of all known bugs we have fixed,
# and can be used to ensure that we don't brake any old fixes in new releases.
# Also problematic patterns not yet properly handled should get test pairs here.
#
# It is possible, and encouraged, to add a comment with the relevant bug ID
# after each (group of) test case. Comments start with <tab>! or <tab>#. If
# you start a comment with a bug ID, it will ensure that all test pairs
# belonging to one bug is grouped together in the test report.
#
# For maintenance reasons, and to easier ensure that all bugs are covered by
# both negative and positive tests, all test pairs are sorted according to bug
# number, and test pairs without a bug number in the beginning. Please add new
# test pairs at the proper location (usually at the end of the document).
