Background
==========

The immediate background for this list is the meeting of the Sámi
language board meeting in Guovdageaidnu, in October, 2005. The list will
be relevant also after this meeting, though. It is a key document to the
normativity issued faced by the sámi spellchecker program, and lists
open normativity issues.

In some cases it is also a question of digging up old documents, and
find earlier decisions, as a certain normativity question has actually
been decided, but is not really enforced, and practice is unstable.

In mail from the administration of SGL 09.03.2006 it is said that words
already existing in dictionaries must be accepted: "Muhtinráje
luoikkassániiin leat juo anus dihto čállinvugiin, vrd čállinvuogi
sátnegirjjiin, iige daid sániid čállinvuogi leat nu álki
rievdadišgoahtit. Mii čujuhit dohkkehuvvon tearbmalisttuide,
sátnegirjjiide, ja giellalávdegotti mearrádusaide." (≈To some degree
loanwords are already in use and written in certain ways, for example in
dictionaries, and it is not so easy to change the way that they should
be written. We refer to accepted terminology lists, dictionaries and
decisions made by SGL. )

We interpret this the way that the grammar of Nickel should be followed
too regarding specific **forms**.

Orthographical conventions
==========================

Short passive forms
-------------------

Should the speller accept short passive forms like this:

**mannojun vs. mannojuvvon**

And short forms like this:

**čállon vs. čállojuvvon**

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Sent to Giellalávdegoddi
3.  Decided on Giellalávdegoddi meeting 131205
4.  Form -**jun** is not acceptable, **čállon** is acceptable

Gerund forms -dettiin vs. –diin/-din
------------------------------------

Should the speller accept short gerunds?

**manadiin/manadin**

For example Nickels grammar show both -dettiin and -diin/-din with the
long form slightly predominating.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Sent to Giellalávdegoddi
3.  Decided on Giellalávdegoddi meeting 131205
4.  All/Both forms acceptable

Placename+noun: Kárášjoh nieida vs. Kárášjohnieida
--------------------------------------------------

Should the placename and the noun be written separately or not. Nickel
does not separate them:

**romssabárdni**

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Sent to Giellalávdegoddi
3.  Decided on Giellalávdegoddi meeting 131205
4.  Should be written **Kárášjoga nieida**

Verbgenitive and neg. and imp. 2p. form of verbs ending with -idit
------------------------------------------------------------------

Verbs ending with -idit could teoretically have verbgenitive and neg.
and imp. 2p.sg forms ending either with -d or with -t:

**skilaidit---&gt;skilait, háliidit---&gt;háliit**

**skilaidit---&gt;skilaid, háliidit---&gt;háliid**

In our corpus there are both forms.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Decided on Sámiid X. konferánsa 20-220678 and Giellalávdegoddi and
    Sámiráđđi meeting 18-191084
3.  End consonant is always **-t**, except in acc/gen pl.

Adjectival forms -eabbo/-abbo vs. –eabbu/-abbu
----------------------------------------------

This is about second stem vowel in comparative forms of odd-stem
adjectives:

****garraseabbo/garrasabbo vs. garraseabbu/garrasabbu****

In the eightees these forms were written predominantly with -u, but
newer normative publications, like Nickels grammar from 1993, show
predominantly -o.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Should be written **-eabbo/-abbo**. This is how it is written in
    grammar by Nickel (see "Background").

Writing of acronyms: NRK:as
---------------------------

This is actually two sub-issues:

-   Should the case form of acronyms be written with colon, hyphen or
    apostroph? Example: **NRK:as** vs **NRK-as** vs **NRK'as**
-   Should consonant-final acronyms spell out the epenthetic -a- or not?
    Example: **NRK:s** vs **NRK:as**
-   This issue is relevant for other cases as well:
    -   \- Numerals **1993:s, 1998:as**.
    -   \- Loan words ending in certain light vowels:
        **Bedriftshelse:in, Bedriftshelsiin, Bedriftshelsein.**
-   We need patterns for all cases and all vowels.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Sent to Giellalávdegoddi
3.  **Partially** decided (the acronyms) on Giellalávdegoddi meeting
    131205
4.  Nom. NSR Akk. NSR Gen. NSR Ill. NSR:i Lok. NSR:s Kom. NSR:in Ess.
    NSR:n
5.  Numerals will be written in the same way as acronyms.
6.  Loan words ending in certain light vowels will be treated as
    indigeanious words, ie: Bedriftshelsiin.

Second syllable deletion in compounds
-------------------------------------

There hasn't been any normative decisions regarding second syllable
deletion when compounding. Čállinrávagirji of the Norwegian Sámediggi
says that forms with second syllable deletion should be avoided when
compounding. They have the example **johgáddi** vs. **johkagáddi**.
Čállinrávagirji doesn't more than touches the subject in a few lines
with just this one example. At the same time there are definitively
occasions where the forms with second syllable deletion have become
norm, as in **sotnabeaiskuvla** (**sotnabeaivviskuvlla**). The question
is where to draw the line. Is the second syllable deletion something
that should only occur in specific compounds, in specific words or in
specific consonant clusters? If so: in what compounds, words or clusters
and how? Pekka Sammalahtis article on compounding (*Sátnegoallosteapmi
ja čállinvuohk*i in Tearbmasympisia raporta, Dieđut nr. 3 1994 s. 35 ff
.Sámi Instituhtta, Alta: 1994) has many examples on forms with deleted
second syllable that has become norm.

1\. bálddoalgái vs. bálddaoalgái...............4A

2\. čázoaivi vs. čázeoaivi............................2

3\. gabboaivi vs. gabbaoaivi......................1

4\. garroaivi vs. garraoaivi..........................1

5\. gaskoapmi vs. gaskaoapmi..................4A

6\. guoddolggoš vs. \*guoddáolggoš........1

7\. guoikkoaivi vs. guoikkaoaivi................4A

8\. mieseadni vs. mieseeadni....................1

9\. muorroaivi vs, muorraoaivi...................1

10\. námmoaivi vs. námmeoaivi...............1

11\. šlubboaivi vs. šlubbooaivi..................1

12\. liigieres vs. liigegieres........................4A

13\. niiboagán vs. niibeboagán................4A

14\. risbárdni vs. ristabárdni......................4A

15\. oaivvuloš vs. oaivevuloš....................4A

16\. njárgeahči vs. njárgageahči..............4A

17\. lihdoaŋggat vs. lihpedoaŋggat.........2

18\. čipbealli vs. cippebealli......................1

19\. vuohppbealli vs vuohppebealli.........2

Using Nickels system (Samisk Grammatikk s. 27 ff. Davvi Girji o.s. 1994)
the consonant clusters are divided into different groups. These are
indicated by the numbers in the right column. Here we can see that the
second syllable deletion isn't always the same within the different
groups. The clusters belonging to one group aren't pronounced/written in
the same way from compound to compound. Difference in case is the most
obvious cause of this like in (3): nominative case vs. (8): genitive
case. But difference in pronouncing/writing is also depending on the
overall fonotactics of a bigger environment , as can be seen in (5):
nominative case vs. (16): nominative case.

In our corpus we see that second syllable deletion isn't at all unusual.
Here are a few examples that reinforce what has already been told,
regarding the consonant cluster types and differences in
pronouncing/writing:

20\. guovttgielat vs. guovttigielat.............4D

21\. guoihgáddi vs guoikagáddi.............4A

22\. gaskabeai- vs. gaskabeaivvi...........4A

23\. geassesaj- vs. geassesaji................3A

24\. maŋŋegeaš- vs. maŋŋegeahči........2

We see here that the consonant cluster types are more than in
Sammalahtis examples. The corpus also shows that there is some confusion
about how second syllable deletion should be written, for example (21):
*guoikgáddi* (?).

Other examples on this phenomenon can be found in the grammars of Konrad
Nielsen (Lærebok i Lappisk, Bind 1, Grammatikk s. 287 ff.
Universitetsforlaget Oslo 1979) and Klaus Peter Nickel (Samisk
Grammatikk s. 387 Davvi Girji o.s. 1994). Especially Nickel reviews
second syllable deletion only in the second part of three-part compounds
though.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Decision on Giellalávdegoddi meeting 181194: "not necessary to use
    apostrohpe, possible to write **čipbealit, niiboagán, vilbealle**.
    h-like sound should be written -**h: čiehgahpir, johgáddi.
    vuohbealle**".
3.  Following the mail from the administration of SGL 09.03.2006 (see
    "Background") most of the listed words above will be accepted by the
    speller. The speller will hence accept single compoundwords with
    secondsyllable deletion and the acceptance will not be fonologically
    based on certain clusters.

Second syllable deletion in specific numerals
---------------------------------------------

This issue is very much alike the issue on second syllable deletion in
compounds:

1\. vihttanuppelot vs. vihttanuppelohkái...........2

2\. viđanuppeloht vs. viđanuppelohkái.............2

Should the speller accept the deletion in these cases. How should it be
written? What about when it is predicative, and when the word is an
attribute?

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  **vihttanuppelot** in Nickel (see "Background") as attribute, hence
    can be used

Dialectal variation
===================

Diphtong simplification -eddjiid vs. no diphtong simplification–eaddjiid
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usually there is dihptong simplification in first syllable when there is
-ii the second syllable:

**geavtit ---&gt; gevttii, beahci ---&gt; beziid**

In Eastern dialects however this rule does not apply when the central
consonantcluster in all inflectionforms is in the strongest grade, grade
III:

**oahpaheaddji ---&gt; oahpaheaddjiid**

Western dialects here show the forms **with** diphtong simplification:

**oahpaheaddji ---&gt; oahpaheddjiid**

In grade III Western dialects show dipht. simpl. before second syllable.
-ui as well:

**goargŋu ---&gt; gorgŋuid**

Also here the Eastern dialects lack dipht. simpl:

**goargŋu ---&gt; goargŋuid**

Normative publications (for example Nickel 1993) show predominantly the
Western forms.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Sent to Giellalávdegoddi
3.  Decided on Giellalávdegoddi meeting 131205
4.  Forms with dipht. simpl. shall be used

Adjectival forms -at/-ut vs. –et/-it
------------------------------------

This are the attributive shortforms of odd-stem adjectives and the
division is between Western and Eastern dialects:

Western: **garraset/garrasit**

Eastern: **garrasat/garrasut**

Nickels grammar shows all these forms.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  All forms in grammar by Nickel (see "Background"). These are hence
    acceptable.

Cons. h vs. š between 2 and third syllable
------------------------------------------

The normal way to write is with *š: jurddašit* and *dárbbašit*. In
dictionaries there are many times both variants though, for example
*jurddahit* (but not *dárbbahit*). Should the speller accept just š or
both?

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Sent to Giellalávdegoddi
3.  Decided on Giellalávdegoddi meeting 131205
4.  Both forms are acceptable

Conditional forms -lit vs. –šit
-------------------------------

These are conditional forms and the division is again between Western
and Eastern dialects:

Eastern: **manašit**

Western: **manalit**

Here Nickels grammar show both forms with the Eastern form slightly
predominating.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Both forms in grammar by Nickel (see "Background"). Both forms
    acceptable.

Conditional forms with diphtong and long -u stem vowel
------------------------------------------------------

Usually there is diphtong simplification in u-verbs when the conditional
forms apply. This is because the long -u shortens to -o.

**soabbut ---&gt; soppolin/soppošin**

Some Western dialects however lack this shortening of stem vowel and
hence also the diphtong simplification:

**soabbut ---&gt; soappulin/soappušin**

Nickels grammar has not these Western forms.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Not in Nickel (see "Background"), hence not acceptable

Conditional alternative form livččon vs. livččen
------------------------------------------------

These are different conditional forms of the verb **leat/leahkit**.
Nickels grammar shows both forms with a predominace for livččen.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Sent to Giellalávdegoddi
3.  Decided on Giellalávdegoddi meeting 131205
4.  Only "normal" forms are acceptable: **livččen**

Plosives in beginning of word: pievlat vs. bievlat and politihkka vs. bolitihkka
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unvoiced plosives are frequent in the Eastern dialects. Here Nickel only
names them when he is talking of indigenius words:

**pievlat**

When talking about loanwords though he writes them with the original
unvoiced plosives:

**kušta, poasta, teaksta**

So this is actually two sub-issues devided into 1. indigenius words and
2. loanwords.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Decided on Sámiid X. konferánsa 20-220678 and Giellalávdegoddi and
    Sámiráđđi meeting 18-191084
3.  Consonants in beginning of words are **b-, d-, g-**. In young
    loanwords it is acceptable to write **p-, d-, k**- too: **kirku**.

Central consonant softening: rievan vs. rieban
----------------------------------------------

In Eastern dialects central consonant -b- softens to -v-:

**rievan**

Nickel only names this.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Sent to Giellalávdegoddi
3.  Decided on Sámiid X. konferánsa 20-220678 and Giellalávdegoddi and
    Sámiráđđi meeting 18-191084
4.  No softening

Du1p of odd-syllable verbs
--------------------------

Du1p og odd-syllable verbs shows many parallel forms:

**hálede, hálededne, háledetne**

Nickel has all three forms.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Sent to Giellalávdegoddi
3.  Decided on Giellalávdegoddi meeting 131205
4.  Only one form should be allowed: -**detne**

Imperative forms
----------------

Imperative forms differ quit a lot:

Evenstems (Nickel shows all forms):

Pl1: **bohtot** (Western) Pl1: **boahttout** (Eastern) Pl2: **bohtet**
(Western) Pl2: **boahttit** (Eastern)

Oddasyllables (Nickel shows some):

Du1 **háliideadnu háliideahkku** Pl1 **háliideadnot háliideahkkot
háliidehkot háliidetnot** Pl2 **háliideahkket háliidehket**

Leat/Leahkit (Nickel shows all forms):

Du1: **leadnu** Du1: **leahkku** Pl1: **lehkot** Pl1: **leatnot**

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Forms that are in Nickel (see "Background") can be used.

Noun shortforms in acc/gen
--------------------------

In the Eastern dialects odd-syllable nouns have a short form in acc/gen:

**beakkán, luopmán**

The western form, which is in Nickel as well, is like this:

**beakkána, luopmána**

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  Only long forms acceptable according to grammar by Nickel (see
    "Background")

Caritative nom. form -hin vs. -heapmi
-------------------------------------

Some western dialects have short nominative caritive form:

**jeagohin**

Nickel here only gives the long counterpart -heapmi.

Status/actions:

1.  Fully described with examples
2.  The form that should be used is -**heapmi**, since -hin not in
    grammar by Nickel (see "Background")

Hyphenation
