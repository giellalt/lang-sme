 * **LEXICON DOT** - Adds the dot to dotted abbreviations.
we also allow different variations of dotted abbreviations at
the end of the sentence (especially for tokenisers)
* "su." gets analysed as `"su" Adv ABBR`
in tokeniser mode also:
* "su." -> `"su" Adv ABBR` + `"." CLB` to account for sentence
final su with no extra full stop.
* also `"son" Pron Pers Sg3 Gen/Acc` + `"." CLB` due to
homonymy.
Same treatment is done with two and three full stops after abbreviation in
the end of the sentence:
* "su.." -> `"su" Adv Abbr` + `"." CLB Err/Orth`
* "su..." -> `"su" Adv Abbr` + `"..." CLB`
