        <title>Introduction</title>

        <p>This is a documentation of the format of the file <a
        href="../sme/twol-sme.txt">twol-sme.txt</a>, the twol rules
        file.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="File_structure">
        <title>File structure</title>

        <p>The file format is documented in <a
        href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/research/mltt/fssoft/docs/twolc-92/twolc92.html">the
        Xerox manual on twolc</a> and in the forthcoming Xerox book. The
        file consists of three sections: The Alphabet section, the Sets
        section and the Rule section. The sections are treated below, one by
        one.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="The_Alphabet_section">
        <title>The Alphabet section</title>

        <p>The Sámi letters were earlier indicated by a1, c1, d1, n1, s1, t1,
        z1. Unicode values for these Northern Sámi letters can be found at the
        relevant chapter of Michael Everson's <a
        href="http://www.evertype.com/alphabets">The Alphabets of
        Europe</a>.</p>

        <p>The other numbered letters point to morphophonemes rather than to
        letters outside the ASCII range. The symbols e1, i1, u1, o1 refer to
        vowels with a special, alternating behaviour. These are the ones that
        are printed with a dot below in Sammallahti's dictionaries and their
        Norwegian pendants. These vowels correspont to Nielsens vowel with
        breve above, and they denote vowels that are short. The symbols h2,
        g2, m2, n2 refer to consonants that alternate in stem-final
        position.</p>

        <p>The dummy symbols X1 to Y8 denote morphophonological processes. X
        are used for nouns only, Y for verbs only, and Q for processes common
        to both nouns and verbs, cf. the following table.</p>

        <p>The dummy symbol :0 is there to prevent consonant gradation for
        certain lexemes. Thus, when a stem ends in , it will not get weak
        grade. Also, the :0 symbol is also a member of the Lenition set.</p>

        <p>For each dummy symbol X1 etc. there is first a list over the rules
        where the dummy applies, and then a partial list of the lexicons where
        there is reference to the dummy in question (the lexica are in the
        file sme-lex.txt, sublexicon paths are indicated by the '-&gt;'
        symbol.</p>

        <title>The <em>Sets</em> section</title>

        <p>Vow and Cns are self-explanatory, StemCns are the stem-final
        consonants.</p>

        <p>WeG is the set of Dummy symbols that trigger weak grade.</p>

        <p>One set is added to the original inventory, the set DummyNotY5. In
        the original file, the rules here involved a subtraction operation
        that did not give the diesired result.</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section id="The_-N1004E">
        <title>The <em>Rules</em> section</title>

        <section id="ij_alternation_rules">
          <title>i:j alternation rules</title>

          <p>This is a problematic alternation. The original 1993 rule did not
          give "muitalit" for "mujtalit". The operator is "&lt;=" instead of
          the usual "&lt;=&gt;", and the rule "Postvocalic j in the stem of
          words" has been added to take care of the mujtalit problem. Compiled
          witout lexicon, the rule "Postvocalic j Surfacing" works well alone,
          but with the lexicon involved it seems both are needed.</p>

          <p><strong>"Postvocalic j Surfacing"</strong> <br />
          <strong>Postvocalic j in the stem of words</strong> <br /> Example:
          "bijlla &gt; biilla".</p>

          <p>These rules turn all underlying j's into i. The phenomenon is
          actually just orthographic: The vowel 'i' does not occur postvocalic
          in Northern Sami, but the consonant 'j' does, albeit it is written
          as "i".</p>

          <p>Testing shows that combining these two rules this way gives the
          correct result, although it is not completely clear why.</p>
