      <title>Flag diacritics</title>

      <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>

        <p>The use of flag diacritics is documented in chapter 8 of the Xerox
        book. The present page documents the flag diacritics format, and the
        use of them in the parser.</p>

        <p>Flag diacritics are used in the Sami morphological parser in order
        to remove illegal compounds, and in order to handle
        automatic downcasing of proper names when they are converted to e.g.
        adjectives.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Flag diacritics format</title>

        <p>There are four types of flag diacritics, all of them with the
        format @operator.feature.value@ or @operator.feature@:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>U or Unification flags, @U.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>U is the unification operator, and the form is accepted if, for
          the relevant feature, the two flags in the derivation string have
          the same value.</dd>

          <dt>P or Positive (Re)Setting, @P.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>Sets or resets the feature to the given value.</dd>

          <dt>N or Negative (Re)Setting, @N.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>Sets or resets the feature to the negation of the given
          value.</dd>

          <dt>R or Require Test, @R.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>For this diacritic, a test is performed, and it succeeds iff
          feature is currently set to value, otherwise the path is
          blocked.</dd>

          <dt>D or Disallow Test, @D.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>A test is performed that succeds if feature is neutral or set to
          a value that is incompatible with value.</dd>

          <dt>C or Clear Feature, @C.feature@</dt>

          <dd>For this flag, the value of feature is reset to neutral.</dd>

          <dt>U or Unification Test, @U.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>If feature is currently neutra, this diacritic causes feature to
          be set to value. Else if feature is currently set, then the test
          succeeds iff value is compatible with the current value of
          feature.</dd>

      <title>Flags diacritics for Sami compounds</title>

      <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>

        <p>Flag diacritics are used in the Sami morphological parser in order
        to remove illegal compounds. </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The problem</title>

        <p>Without flag diacritics, compounds with derived nouns are
        errouneously blocked, or, if they are accepted,</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Too strict:</dt> 
            <dd>only N + N accepted, N + [V-suf]N is not</dd>
            <dt>Too sloppy:</dt>
            <dd>also N + V accepted, not only N + [V-suf]N</dd>
            <dt>Correct: </dt>
            <dd>accept compound only if 2nd part is N at end of derivation</dd>
        </dl>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>A solution</title>

        <ol>
          <li>The Nominative and Genitive sublexica of all NounRoot entries
          are lead to the R lexicon (as earlier).</li>

          <li>From there, they go to NounRoot again without flag diacritics.
          They are also led to VerbRoot and AdjectiveRoot, but equipped with a
          compound flag diacritic. Then, all affixes that turn adjectives and
          verbs into nouns are equipped with a corresponding diacritic.</li>

          <li>Compounds with only an unsaturated diacritic are removed,
          whereas compounds with a saturated diacritic are accepted.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>A sketch</title>

        <p>Here, the P and R diacritics are used, as shown with the R lexicon
        and two lexica for deverbal nouns, that takes verbal stems as input.
        The P diacritic sets the value of cmpnd to N, and the R diacritic
        requires a test.</p>

            <dd># NounRoot ;</dd>
            <dd>#@P.cmpnd.N@   VerbRoot ;</dd>

      <title>Flag diacritics for downcasing of derived proper nouns</title>

      <section>
        <title>The problem</title>
        
        <fixme author="Trond">This is fixed, isn't it?</fixme>
        <p>All proper nouns may be turned into adjectives of the type London
        &gt; Londoner, in Sámi, Oslo &gt; oslolaš. In Sámi, the capital letter
        of the proper name must be downcased.</p>

        <p>An earlier solution was to write a twol rule that exchanged all
        initial uppercase letters with an initial lowercase one if the stem
        was followed by the right kind of derivational suffix (this rule is
        still found at the end of the twol-sme.txt file, where it is commented
        out). This solution was abandoned, since the compilation time was
        simply too long</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>A solution involving flag diacritics</title>

        <p>A possible solution is to use flag diacritics, in the same way as
        we used flag diacritics to fix compounds.</p>

        <p>The tags <code>@U.Cap.Obl@ @U.Cap.Opt@</code> were introduced (cf.
        the <code>sme-lext.txt </code>file), but so far, we don't have a
        working solution. The problem is documented (for Finnish) in section
        8.5.5. (of the pre-published version), and on pp. 368-372 in the
        published version of the B&amp;K book.</p>

        <p>Working on it (Trond): I copied the two files demo-lex.txt (the
        lexc file) and lexscript.xfst (the xfst script). I then saved the
        former as lex.fst (in lexc) and ran the latter (in xfst). The lexc
        commands were:</p>

        <source>compile-source demo-lex.txt
obey-flags
source-to-result
save-result lex.fst</source>

        <p>The sole xfst command was:</p>

        <source>source paloscript.xfst</source>

        <p>The resulting message from xfst is seen below:</p>

        <source>xfst[0]: source paloscript.xfst
Opening file paloscript.xfst...

 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Composing the rules under the lexicon
1.8 Kb. 38 states, 45 arcs, 18 paths.
flex scanner jammed</source>

        <p>According to the Book, we should have two networks, so that is ok.
        The question is why we get the final message (<code>flex scanner
        jammed</code>), and how we shall get the demo work, and thereafter how
        we can make our own problem work.</p>

        <title>Appendix: The files used</title>

        <p>These two files were copied from the B&amp;K book. No attempt was
        done do modify them, as the first goal should be to get them to
        work.</p>
