      <title>A flowchart over the sme files for morphological parsing</title>
      <p>This flowchart gives an overview of how the sme sourcefiles are related. In principle, the other lg files are arranged in the same way.</p>
      <p/>
      <source>The main lex file            Separate lex files for different POS (parts
                                                               of speech)

|                      |    |        |         |  The files for nouns, verbs and

                                                  there are ca. 10 lex files.

This is compiled together with the        ||
twol rules. These rules contain the       ||
(morpho)phonological processes,           ||
consonant gradation, etc.                 \/

The case.regex file is com-
piled in xfst. The preprocessor
itself, tok.fst, is not shown here.
