# Tags and sets #

SETS

# I define end of clause and beginning of clause in a way so that the file
# may be read both by the CG-2 and the vislcg formalisms.

LIST BOS = (>>>) (<s>);
LIST EOS = (<<<) (</s>);

# CG3 doesn´t function without >>> and <<< !

# Tags declared as single-membered LISTs 
# ======================================

# Include a list of all tags declared as themselves:
INCLUDE ../../src/cg3/generated-tag-list.cg3 ;

# Olang tags:
# -----------

LIST OLANG = /^OLang\/.*/r ;
LIST ACR = ACR ;
LIST Cmp = Cmp ;

SECTION

# When some part of the compoound contains a loan word, select the dynamic
# compound, not the lexicalised one:
SUBSTITUTE SUB:1 (Cmp) (*) TARGET (Cmp) ;
