    \item Number agreement: determiner and noun, adjective
    \item Gender agreement: determiner and noun, adjective and noun, pronoun and noun

    \item Agreement between subject and subject-complement: The check for non-agreeing subject complements is restricted to sentence-initial main clauses with the copula være
    \item Negative polarity items: Warning and suggestion mechanism regarding correct uses of ingen and noen as determiner in positive and negative sentences
    \item Gender agreement: quantifying pronoun and av-phrase

    \item Oblique form of personal pronouns when governed by a preposition
    \item nogen vs. nogle
    \item heller vs. hellere
\end{itemize}

\section{Error types and error type distinctions}

\subsection{Error type distinctions}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1) Errors caused by a sloppy use of the "cut and paste" options of modern text editors, and 2) errors due to people's mistaken beliefs about the written language norms. \citet{Hagen2001a}
\item typographical errors (typing errors or OCR scanning errors), orthographical errors (erroneous transliterations of phonemes to graphemes) and, most importantly, morpho-syntactic errors (resulting from misapplication of morphological inflection and syntactic rules) \citet{Vosse1992}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Error types}

\begin{itemize}
\item Notoriously difficult to spot are word doubling errors, especially at the end of a line \citet{Vosse1992}
\item errors in idiomatic expressions (some words/forms occurr only in idiomatic expressions)
\item compound conventions
\item comma errors
\item Parity of parentheses, of brackets, of braces (FINGRC)
\item  Uneven number of quotation marks (FINGRC)
\item Errors caused by a sloppy use of the "cut and paste" options of modern text editors
\item agreement errors (typical syntactic errors) \citet{Vosse1992}
\item homophony: words having the same pronunciation but a different spelling, A special case of homophonous words are words which differ only in inflection.
\end{itemize}

\section{Other CG grammar checkers}

\begin{itemize}
\item Catalan system: makes use of CATCG, a modular general-purpose shallow morphosyntactic parser for unrestricted Catalan text (Badia et al., 2001), several error detection modules (CatSpel - dealing with non-words; CG-based morphological error detection module: simple orthographic errors resulting in words such as wrong use of apostrophe, or wrong NP-agreement; CG-based negative n-gram error detection module: wrong word sequences; CG-based morphosyntactic error detection module: subject-verb disagreement, subcategorization errors, etc.; domain-specific modules: certain semantic or pragmatic errors), CATCG’s morphological disambiguation grammar and syntactic mapping module has been modified in such a way that word sequences that otherwise would imply a wrong or simply a non disambiguation are now analysed as a possible reading.
%Up to now only bigrams and trigrams have been used (also implemented
%using CG-based grammar). They have been collected
%via a semi-automatic procedure of detection errors
%in a POS-tagged corpus similar to the one used by (Kveton
%and Oliva, 2002).
\item Esperanto language helper (grammar checker with pedagogical advice): CG-parser EspGram (accuracy rate (F-score) of 92.1\% for syntactic parsing and dependency on ordinary Esperanto texts with few errors), CG3 based including dependencies, Esperanto users on an intermediate or high level of proficiency or, more precisely, those who do not have an error density higher than 1 error / 10 words.
\item
\end{itemize}

\section{Precision and Recall}

\begin{itemize}
\item Precision: good alarms divided by the sum of good alarms and false alarms
\item Swedish grammar checker (see Birn 2000, Arppe 2000): resulting precision 70\% (according to Birn 2000:38), counted as good alarms divided by the sum of good alarms and false alarms. 
\item Norwegian grammar checker is 75 \% precision from a test corpus of 890 000 words from the newspapers Nordlys and Sarbsborg Blad \citet{Hagen2001a} (However, depending on what kind of text that is used as a test corpus and what kind of rules that are included, these numbers can vary a great deal. For example, if we include a rule that tests whether there are any finite verbs in a sentence, and apply the grammar checker on newspaper text with a lot of verb-less headlines, the precision rises to approximately 91 \% (and the same goes for the Swedish grammar checker).
\end{itemize}

\section{Relation spellchecker grammarchecker}

\begin{itemize}
\item Before entering the sentence level (i.e., parsing a sentence), a spelling module should check on all the words in the sentence. \citet{Vosse1992}
\item
\end{itemize}

\section{Resolving compound errors}

There are three problems involved
in compound analysis: (1) not every sequence of dictionary
words forms a legal compound, (2) certain
parts of a compound cannot be found in the dictionary
and (3) full analysis usually comes up with
too many alternatives. My solution follows the lines
set out in (Daelemans, 1987): a deterministic word
parser, constrained by the grammar for legal compounds,
that comes up with the left-most longest
solution first. This solution is rather fast on legal
compounds, while it takes at most O(n 2) time for
nonexistent words and illegal compounds. \citet{Vosse1992}
