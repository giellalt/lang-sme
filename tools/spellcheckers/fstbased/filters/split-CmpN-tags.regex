# This filter splits a row of CmpN tags into parallel paths with single tags.
# This is the first step of two in converting CmpN tags into flag diacritics
# that will regulate compounding behaviour in fst-based spellers.

# The split is done independently for the regular CmpN tags, the CmpNLeft tags
# and the CmpNDEf tags.
