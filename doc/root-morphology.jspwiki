Divvun & Giellatekno - open source grammars for SÃ¡mi and other languages









!!Tags for indicating the orthography used
 +Orth/Strd - Standard orthography
 +Orth/IPA - IPA transcription

The above should either be used in pairs, or not at all. That is, if a word
doesn't need an IPA stem (because the word in all its inflection can be
converted to IPA by the standard IPA conversion rules), then none of these
tags should be used.
On the other hand, if the word has a spelling that doesn't follow the
orthographic rules, and thus needs an exceptional IPA stem to get it right,
then the exceptional stem must be marked with the {{+Orth/IPA}}, and the
regular orthography stem must be marked with the tag {{+Orth/Strd}}. This is
so that we can exclude the one or the other from different fst's, but only
when the oposite stem variant is present.

!Multichars for marking start and end of IPA sequences
 * %{%<ipa#%} - ipa text to the left
 * %{#ipa%>%} - ipa text to the right
