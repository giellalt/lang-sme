!!Tags for indicating the orthography used
 +Orth/Strd - Standard orthography
 +Orth/IPA - IPA transcription

The above should either be used in pairs, or not at all. That is, if a word
doesn't need an IPA stem (because the word in all its inflection can be
converted to IPA by the standard IPA conversion rules), then none of these
tags should be used.
On the other hand, if the word has a spelling that doesn't follow the
orthographic rules, and thus needs an exceptional IPA stem to get it right,
then the exceptional stem must be marked with the {{+Orth/IPA}}, and the
regular orthography stem must be marked with the tag {{+Orth/Strd}}. This is
so that we can exclude the one or the other from different fst's, but only
when the oposite stem variant is present.

!Multichars for marking start and end of IPA sequences
 * %{%<ipa#%} - ipa text to the left
 * %{#ipa%>%} - ipa text to the right

!!Tags for originating language
The following tags are used to guide conversion to IPA: loan words
and foreign names are usually pronounced (approximately) as in the
originating (majority) language. Instead of trying to identify the
correct pronounciation based on fonotactics (orthotactics actually),
we tag all words that can't be correctly transcribed using the SME
transcriber with source language codes. Once tagged, it is possible
to split the lexical transducer in smaller ones according to langu-
age, and apply different IPA conversion to each of them.

The principle of tagging is that we only tag to the extent needed,
and following a priority:
# any untagged word is pronounced with SME orthographic conventions
# NNO and NOB have identical pronounciation, NNO is only used if
  different in spelling from NOB
# SWE has mostly the same pronounciation as NOB, and is only used
  if different in spelling from NOB
# Occasionally even SME (the default) may be tagged, to block other
  languages from being specified, mainly during semi-automatic
  language tagging sessions

All in all, we want to get as much correctly transcribed to IPA
with as little work as possible. On the other hand, if more words
are tagged than strictly needed, this should pose no problem as
long as the IPA conversion is correct - at least some words will
get the same pronounciation whether read as SME or NOB/NNO/SWE.
