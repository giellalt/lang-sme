!!!Delimiters 



!!!TAGS AND SETS


!!Sets containing lists of tags






* Sets for parts of speech






* Sets for POS sub-categories





* Sets for Semantic tags






* Sets for Morphosyntactic properties






























* Sets for Derivation






* Sets for Syntactic tags


























* Sets for Single-word sets






!!Sets containing sets of lists and tags


* Sets for word or not




* Derivational affixes






* Case sets





* Verb sets



* Sets for finiteness and mood











* Sets for person















* Sets consisting of forms of "leat" (these ones need to be rewritten)




* Pronoun sets














* Adjectival sets and their complements








* Adverbial sets and their complements










* Sets for coordinators








* Sets for adverbs that have lookalikes














* Sets of elements with common syntactic behaviour


* Sets for verbs
** V is all readings with a V tag in them, REAL-V should
be the ones without an N tag following the V.  
The REAL-V set thus awaits a fix to the preprocess V ... N bug.



* The set COPULAS is for predicative constructions













TRANS-V is the set for verbs really taking objects

* Sets for verbs choosing oblique objects or adverbials




STRICT-TRANS-V is the set for verbs which don't leat a GenAcc be a modifyer of anything else than an object, e.g. Mun organiseren eatni gievkkanis. - eatni wants to be the object

























* Valency sets



































































* Adverb sets









* Adjective sets






















* NP sets defined according to their morphosyntactic features









* The PRE-NP-HEAD family of sets

These sets model noun phrases (NPs). The idea is to first define whatever can
occur in front of the head of the NP, and thereafter negate that with the
expression __WORD - premodifiers__.











The set __NOT-NPOD__ is used to find barriers between NPs.
Typical usage: ... (*1 N BARRIER NPT-NPMOD) ...
meaning: Scan to the first noun, ignoring anything that can be
part of the noun phrase of that noun (i.e., "scan to the next NP head")






* Other negatively defined morphosyntactic noun sets












* Noun sets

Nominal sets defined according to their morphophonological properties
Sets for lexeme homonymy (most of them are moved to where the actual rules are.)


The words in the set __N-PO__ can be both N and Po, the set takes that into account.


* The LAHKA set family





















* Nominal sets defined according to their semantical properties


* Spatial noun sets. These nouns behave like postpositions




* Time sets































* Amount sets

















* Sets for nouns with morpho-syntactic preferences

* Number-related sets






* Sets for case, possessive, etc.














* Sets for nouns as pred






































* Sets for animals













* Sets for things
























* Sets for qualities


* Sets for things, not necessarily tools



















* Sets for things such that people can be inside them:

* Sets for things such that people cannot be inside them:






* Part-whole sets for human




* Sets for places




























* Sets that can both be buildings/places and represent humans

























































* Sets denoting relations





* Miscellaneous sets



















* Border sets and their complements















* Syntactic sets




These were the set types.

!!!VERBS

!!Disambiguating verbs - part 1 

First ConNeg forms, they are dependent upon Neg verbs. Then Imperative 
(with their special syntax), infinitive, and other infinite forms. 
Person comes later (in part 2)



!!ConNeg forms

* __ConNegImp__ selects ConNeg Imprt if Neg Imprt to the left.

* __ConNegIfNeg__ selects Ind ConNeg if Neg Ind to the left. This is the main (and common) ConNeg rule.

* __ConNegCondIfNeg__ selects Cond ConNeg if Neg Cond to the left. Less used, obviously.







* __NotConNegII__ removes ConNegII if no Neg Imprt around. This is important, as the homonym forms are common.



* __NotConNegIfNotNeg__ removes ConNeg if no Neg to the left. Consider unifying with NotConNegNotNeg.

* __NotConNegNotNeg__ removes remaining ConNegs whenever no Neg to the left.






!!Imperative

See also ''Imprt or Ind'' some sections down.

* __ImprtLeat__ 

* __ImprtDál__ 


* __ImprtComma__ 

* __ImprtNotVGen
