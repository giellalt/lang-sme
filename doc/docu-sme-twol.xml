      <title>Documenting the North Saami twol rules file</title>

      <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>

        <p>This is a documentation of the format of the file
        <code>gt/sme/twol-sme.txt</code>, the twol rules file.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>File structure</title>

        <p>The file format, as well as the rule formalism and the usage of the
        twolc program, is documented in <a
        href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/fssoft/docs/twolc-92/twolc92.html">the
        Xerox manual on twolc</a>. The file itself consists of three sections:
        The Alphabet section, the Sets section and the Rule section. The
        sections are treated below, one by one.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The Alphabet section</title>

        <p>The parser uses the Saami letters that are found in the offical
        spelling, i.e. <em>á, č, đ, ŋ, š, ŧ, ž</em>, in the UTF-8 encoding
        scheme of Unicode. Unicode values for these North Saami letters can
        be found at the relevant chapter of Michael Everson's <a
        href="http://www.evertype.com/alphabets">The Alphabets of
        Europe</a>.</p>

        <p>There are also some numbered letters in the alphabet section. They
        point to morphophonemes. The symbols <em>e7, i7, u7, o7</em> refer to
        vowels with a special, alternating behaviour. These are the ones that
        are printed with a dot below in Sammallahti's dictionaries and their
        Norwegian pendants. These vowels correspont to Nielsens vowel with
        breve above, and they denote vowels that are short. The symbols
        <em>h8, g8, m8, n8</em> refer to consonants that alternate in
        stem-final position. The symbols <em>b9, d9, g9, h9, j9, m9, n9, p9,
        s9, t9, z9</em> refer to consonants <em>b, d, g, h</em>, etc., that do
        not alternate, despite the behaviour of similar Saami consonants. Thus,
        the word 'viehkat' has the stem viehkag, whereas the word 'Rollag' has
        the stem Rollag9. This is to distinguish betweed the alternating
        <em>-g</em> in 'viehkag' (which turns to <em>-t</em> in word-final
        position), and the non-alternating <em>-g9</em> in 'Rollag9' (which
        always is realised as <em>g</em>).</p>

        <p>The symbol ¤ has two different functions. It prevents consonant
        gradation, and it prevents the word-final vowel weakening i &gt; e, u
        &gt; o.</p>

        <p>The dummy symbols <em>X</em>1 to <em>Y8</em> denote
        morphophonological processes. <em>X</em> are used for <em>nouns</em>
        only, <em>Y</em> for verbs only, and <em>Q</em> for processes common
        to both nouns and verbs, cf. the following table.</p>
        
        <p>There are also (so far undocumented) W symbols</p>

        <p>The dummy symbol <em>:0</em> is there to prevent consonant
        gradation for certain lexemes. Thus, when a stem ends in <em>:0</em>,
        it will not get weak grade. Also, the <em>:0</em> symbol is also a
        member of the Lenition set.</p>

        <p>For each dummy symbol <em>X1</em> etc. there is first a list over
        the rules where the dummy applies, and then a partial list of the
        lexicons where there is reference to the dummy in question (the lexica
        are in the file sme-lex.txt, sublexicon paths are indicated by the
        '-&gt;' symbol.</p>

        <title>The <em>Sets</em> section</title>

        <p>Vow and Cns are self-explanatory, StemCns are the stem-final
        consonants.</p>

        <p>WeG is the set of Dummy symbols that trigger weak grade.</p>

        <p>One set is added to the original inventory, the set DummyNotY5. In
        the original file, the rules here involved a subtraction operation
        that did not give the desired result.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The Rules section</title>

        <section>
          <title>i:j alternation rules</title>

          <p>This is a problematic alternation. The original 1993 rule did not
          give "muitalit" for "mujtalit". The operator is "&lt;=" instead of
          the usual "&lt;=&gt;", and the rule "Postvocalic j in the stem of
          words" has been added to take care of the mujtalit problem. Compiled
          without lexicon, the rule "Postvocalic j Surfacing" works well
          alone, but with the lexicon involved it seems both are needed.</p>

          <p><strong>"Postvocalic j Surfacing"</strong> <br />
          <strong>Postvocalic j in the stem of words</strong> <br /> Example:
          "bijlla &gt; biilla".</p>

          <p>These rules turn all underlying j's into i. The phenomenon is
          actually just orthographic: The vowel 'i' does not occur postvocalic
          in North Sami, but the consonant 'j' does, albeit it is written
          as "i".</p>

          <p>Testing shows that combining these two rules this way gives the
          correct result, although it is not completely clear why.</p>
