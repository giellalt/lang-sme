      <title>A flowchart over the sme files for morphological parsing</title>
      <p>This flowchart gives an overview of how the sme sourcefiles are related. In principle, the other lg files are arranged in the same way.</p>

      <source>The main lex file            Separate lex files for different POS (parts

                                                  there are ca. 10 lex files.
