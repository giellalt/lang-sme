 Sámi language technology project 2003-2014, University of Tromsø # 

This file adds syntactic functions. It is common for all the Saami
















* Sets for POS sub-categories





* Sets for Semantic tags





* Sets for Morphosyntactic properties







































































































































































* Sets for verbs


** V is all readings with a V tag in them, REAL-V should
be the ones without an N tag following the V.  
The REAL-V set thus awaits a fix to the preprocess V ... N bug.



* The set COPULAS is for predicative constructions







* NP sets defined according to their morphosyntactic features







* The PRE-NP-HEAD family of sets

These sets model noun phrases (NPs). The idea is to first define whatever can
occur in front of the head of the NP, and thereafter negate that with the
expression __WORD - premodifiers__.












The set __NOT-NPMOD__ is used to find barriers between NPs.
Typical usage: ... (*1 N BARRIER NPT-NPMOD) ...
meaning: Scan to the first noun, ignoring anything that can be
part of the noun phrase of that noun (i.e., "scan to the next NP head")






* Miscellaneous sets





















* Border sets and their complements













* Syntactic sets





These were the set types.

!!SUBJ MAPPING - leftovers

!!OBJ MAPPING - leftovers


!!HNOUN MAPPING

! __missingX__ adds @X to all missings





! __therestX__ adds @X to all what is left, often errouneus disambiguated forms


! __smeRemove__ removes the language tags <sma>, <sme>,  etc, before proceeding to the dep file.






!!For Apertium: 
The analysis give double analysis because of optional semtags. We go for the one with semtag. 



!!For Korp:

Here we remove semantic tags for all other words than
proper nouns.
