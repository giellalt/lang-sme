!!!TAGS AND SETS


!!Sets containing lists of tags






* Sets for parts of speech






* Sets for POS sub-categories





* Sets for Semantic tags






* Sets for Morphosyntactic properties






























* Sets for Derivation






* Sets for Syntactic tags



























* Sets for Single-word sets






!!Sets containing sets of lists and tags


* Sets for word or not






* Derivational affixes







* Case sets





* Verb sets



* Sets for finiteness and mood










* Sets for person















* Sets consisting of forms of "leat" (these ones need to be rewritten)




* Pronoun sets
















* Adjectival sets and their complements









* Adverbial sets and their complements










* Sets for coordinators








* Sets for adverbs that have lookalikes















* Sets of elements with common syntactic behaviour


* Sets for verbs


** V is all readings with a V tag in them, REAL-V should
be the ones without an N tag following the V.  
The REAL-V set thus awaits a fix to the preprocess V ... N bug.



* The set COPULAS is for predicative constructions














TRANS-V is the set for verbs really taking objects




* Sets for verbs choosing oblique objects or adverbials




STRICT-TRANS-V is the set for verbs which don't let a GenAcc be a modifier of anything else than an object, e.g. Mun organiseren eatni gievkkanis. - eatni wants to be the object
























* Valency sets


















































* __PLACE-V__ Those get only not locative if the target is a member TOOL, ABSTR-TOOL or ANIMATE or CONCEPT. Selects more locatives than ONLY-PLACE-LOC-V 

















* Adverb sets









* Adjective sets






















* NP sets defined according to their morphosyntactic features










* The PRE-NP-HEAD family of sets

These sets model noun phrases (NPs). The idea is to first define whatever can
occur in front of the head of the NP, and thereafter negate that with the
expression __WORD - premodifiers__.











The set __NOT-NPMOD__ is used to find barriers between NPs.
Typical usage: ... (*1 N BARRIER NPT-NPMOD) ...
meaning: Scan to the first noun, ignoring anything that can be
part of the noun phrase of that noun (i.e., "scan to the next NP head")






* Other negatively defined morphosyntactic noun sets













* Noun sets

Nominal sets defined according to their morphophonological properties
Sets for lexeme homonymy (most of them are moved to where the actual rules are.)


The words in the set __N-PO__ can be both N and Po, the set takes that into account.


* The LAHKA set family





















* Nominal sets defined according to their semantical properties


* Spatial noun sets. These nouns behave like postpositions




* Time sets































* Amount sets
















* Sets for nouns with morpho-syntactic preferences

* Number-related sets






* Sets for case, possessive, etc.














* Sets for nouns as pred






































* Sets for animals













* Sets for things
























* Sets for qualities


* Sets for things, not necessarily tools


















* Sets for things such that people can be inside them:

* Sets for things such that people cannot be inside them:






* Part-whole sets for human




* Sets for places






























* Sets that can both be buildings/places and represent humans
























































* Sets denoting relations





* Miscellaneous sets



















* Border sets and their complements














* Syntactic sets




These were the set types.

* __VDu1IfMoaiRight__ selects Du1 when "moai" right (r961)



!Du2 - early cycle, safe rules

The next two rules are not found in the corpus, but logically
they belong, to cover the whole paradigm. There is no verb-internal
homonymy here, but there is homonymy with e.g. Illative for certain verbs.

* __VDu2IFDoaiLeft__ selects Du2 if "doai" to the left (r962)

* __EssNotV__ selects Ess instead of VFIN


!PrsPrc

* __PrsPrc__ selects PrsPrc if coordinated with A - 10
Early rule since many PrsPrc readings are removed later.

* __ENInf2__ selects Inf (NOTE, this was further down in sme-dis)


!!!Section 4: CYCLE 1B: REMOVING THE READINGS THAT WERE LEFT FROM THE 1A RULES

* __NnotAcoord__ removes A instead of N (earlier: selects N instead of A), based on coordination with N, and a vfin-verb

* __NPlbeforeRel, NSgbeforeRel__ select N in front of Rel and MO

!!Adjectives and adverbs

!Adv or not?
maid has many readings and as Rel it is a member of S-BOUNDARY. Therefore we need to disambiguate is early in this file. Most important is to select Adv. Because of that A ang N still can have Vfin readings, it is difficult to make very general rules.

* __vaikkomii__

* __Interj__ or not

* __maidAdv1__ selects maid Adv when there is no vfin to the right.

* __maidAdv2__ selects maid Adv copulas and PrfPrc or Actio Ess. We need this rule because of that there can be an Inf to the right which also has Vfin reading.

* __KillmaidAdv__ removed the remaining maid Adv

__matPcle__

The following two rules are omitted. They only inflect on the disambiguation of mat pcle, a wackernagel, which is done in the rule over here, I think.






* __olluNom__ 






* __olluAdv__

!The super-set Dynamic-verb according to choose (Pl Loc) or (Sg Com)

The idea is that the superset DYNAMIC-V are not connected to TOOL, ABSTR-TOOL or CONCEPT in (Pl Loc). This is the "minste felles multiplum". The sub-sets are different, f.i. many of them (but not all) are not connected to HUMAN in (Pl Loc), one is not connected to ABSTR-ENTITY and ACTOR in (Pl Loc). We work with negation so the rules don´t destroy analysis because of insufficent sets. 

First the general-rules for selecting (Sg Com), then the more special rules for selecting (Sg Com), and then we selct (Pl Loc) for the rest of them under # Another round of locative rules.
