!!!Punctuation symbols

 * __LEXICON Punctuation_SME   __ contains the list
of punctuation symbols that are problematic from a normative
point of view, and only those. Everything else is coming from
the standard Punctuation lexicon.

They are all tagged ''+RIGHT'' even though the correct quotation
mark is supposed to be used on both sides. This is done to simplify
generation, by keeping the same tagging as the standard analysis.
