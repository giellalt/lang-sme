      <title>File structure</title>
      <p>The file format is documented in the Xerox manuals, especially in <link href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/research/mltt/fssoft/docs/lexc-93/lexc93.html" >Karttunen 1993 Finite-State Lexicon Compiler</link>, but see also the forthcoming Beesley and Karttunen book. The file consists of a section defining Multichar_symbols, and of a large number of lexica, 183 lexica according to the present count (19.10.01). The file sme-lex.txt contains a.o. the continuation lexica for nouns, verbs and adjectives, whereas the bulk of the lexicon is divided into different files, as indicated below.</p>
      <p>In the sme-lex.txt file, the <strong>Multichar_Symbols</strong> section contains all grammatical tags, and all multicharacter members of the alphabet (the latter set is taken from the grammar file).</p>
      <p>The <strong>Root</strong> lexicon points to the lexica of the different parts of speech: (for each sublexicon there is a pointer to the relevant file containing the sublexicon)</p>

          <strong>NounRoot</strong> has the lexica BOAZU, FALIS, GADDI, GAHPIR, GISTTA, GOAHTI, JOHTOLAT, MALIS, SEAMU, STAHTA, VIVVA. The lexica represent the following inflectional types:</p>

          <strong>Propernoun</strong> is divided into two sublexica, SamiProperNoun and GeneralProperNoun (this division is for clarity reasons, and can be dispensed with as soon as the structure of all the names is clear.). here are the lexica:</p>
        <source>ACCRA = foreign names ending in a stressless vowel.
NYSTï¿½= foreign names ending in a stressed vowel.
CNAME = foreign names ending in a consonant
C-FI-NEN = Finnish names of the &quot;Itkonen&quot; type, with Gen = Itkosa / Itkonena
LONDON ! Final foot structure (X.) and (X..) => Loc:is
BERN ! Final foot structure (X) => Loc:as

        <p>These are the lexica for Sáami names:</p>
        <p>NIILLAS = trisyllabic, non-gradating C-proper names.</p>

          <title>Comments to the verb sublexica</title>
          <p>Within each of the main groups, there are three types, impersonal verbs and verbs with and without personal passives. The difference between <em>i/a/u</em> and <em>e/á/o</em> verbs is handeled in the rules file, and not in the lexicon file.</p>
          <p>The with / without Personal Passive distinction shows up in one sublexicon. DOHPPE has PASSIVE, where GILLE has SG3PASS. So, this is (probably) a transivity difference, cf. also <em>diehtit</em> vs. <em>boahtit</em>. It seems thus that the difference is one of transitivity: 0, 1 and 2 valence.</p>
          <p>At present, the file <em>verb-sme-lex.txt</em> comtains all the verbs. In the beginning of the file, all sublexica are exemplified. Then follows the bulk of the verbs, twosyllabic even, manysyllabic even, odd and contracted verbs. These verbs are all given the sublexica DIEHTI, MUITAL and DOHPPE, i.e., they are given the transitive sublexicon, the maximal paradigm.</p>
          <p>TODO: Assign corrct transitivity/sublexicon marking to the bulk of the verbs. Also, the undefined sublexica should be investigated.</p>
          <p>Pekka gives them the following comment to the dec 01 files:</p>
          <p>Tiedosto sisï¿½tï¿½ verbiartikkelien hakusanat. Joissakin tapauksissa on myï¿½ vaihtoehtoja (x ~ y) ja variantin kohdalla on viite pï¿½hakusanaan (x gc1. y). Pituusviivalliset vokaalimerkit on korvattu x2-yhdistelmillï¿½ pisteelliset x3-yhdistelmillï¿½ Kolmannen kestoasteen merkkinï¿½on ', jonka koodi DOS:ssa on 173. Joidenkin hakusanojen yhteydessï¿½on suluissa tietoa rektiosta, esim. liikot (+ lok.); tï¿½ï¿½tieto ei ole toistaiseksi systemaattista.</p>

          <title>Overview of the lexicon structure</title>
          <p>The numeral lexica are formed as a generator, generating all possible numerals. The basic lexicon is Numeral, and it looks like this:</p>
          <p/>
          <source>LEXICON Numeral
MILJON ; ! a noun of its own
UNDERDUHAT ; ! for generator under 1000
JUSTDUHAT ; ! going via 1000
OVERDUHAT ; ! for generator over 1000
OLD ; ! for &quot;thirteen hundred, etc.
!num-basic ; ! replaced by the 5 lexica above
num-ordinal ; ! The basic ordinal numbers
!num-derived ; ! still unimplemented
num-imprecise ;! still almost unimplemented
ARABIC ; ! for the arabic numerals
ROMAN ; ! for the roman numerals
</source>
          <p>MILJON is a noun. OLD is the old way of counting. num-ordinal act like adjectives, they are not finished yet. ARABIC and ROMAN contain number generators.</p>
          <p>So, what is the reasin for the three different lexica around 1000?</p>
          <p>The path is OVERDUHAT -> JUSTDUHAT -> UNDERDUHAT. OVERDUHAT generates the part of the numeral that is over 1000, and all these lexica then point to JUSTDUHAT. That lexicon has an optional &quot;(one) thousand&quot; before it leads either to DUHAT and via the relevant case paradigm to K, or to UNDERDUHAT. UNDERDUHAT contains the numerals 1-999. UNDERDUHAT starts with the lexicon for one, and gives each group of numerals its own lexicon.</p>

          <title>Case inflection of numerals</title>
          <p>At the moment, the numerals only case inflected for the last part.</p>

    <section id="Indeclinable_words" >
      <title>Indeclinable words</title>
      <p>All the lexica for indeclinable words are made the same way:</p>
      <p/>
      <source>LEXICON Root
Adverb ;
 LEXICON Adverb
 a1d1amusat adv ;
  LEXICON adv
  +Adv:0 K ;
</source>
      <p>The Root lexicon points to the POS lexica (Adverb etc.). Each of the POS lexica lists the entries, with a pointer to an arbitrarily named sublexicon (here &quot;adv&quot;). This sublexicon contains the grammatical tag for the POS in question (the tag has no surface form, hence &quot;:0&quot;), and eventually a pointer towards the cliticon lexicon K. Adverbs can have clitics added, hence K, whereas subjunctions do not, hence no K. [XXX At the moment particles are not directed to K, perhaps they should be.]</p>
      <section id="Adverbs" >
        <title>Adverbs</title>
        <p>They are explained in the intro above.</p>
        <p/>
      </section>
      <section id="Particles" >
        <title>Particles</title>
        <p>These are in the closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +Pcle and th|qeir lexicon path is:</p>
        <p>Root -> Particle -> pcle -> #</p>
        <p/>
      </section>
      <section id="Subjunctions" >
        <title>Subjunctions</title>
        <p>Subjunctions are <em>ahte, juos</em>, etc. These are in the closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their lexicon path is:</p>
        <p>Root -> Subjunction -> -> #</p>
        <p/>
      </section>
      <section id="Conjunctions" >
        <title>Conjunctions</title>
        <p>Conjunctions are <em>ja, dahjege</em>, etc. These are in the closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +CC and their lexicon path is:</p>
        <p>Root -> Conjunction -> Cc -> #</p>
        <p/>
      </section>
      <section id="P-positions" >
        <title>P-positions</title>
        <p>There are three different classes here: Postpositions, occuring after their complement, prepositions, occuring before, and adpositions, occuring both before and after. This could have been done the Lingsoft way as well: Having +Adp as a common tag for both, and eventually +Prep and +Postp as subtags, no subtag would indicate both ways (or both subtags could be used). At the moment, they are left as 3 distinct groups. The classification is based upon Nickel, p-positions found only in Sammallahti's dictionary and not in Nickel were put in the Adposition group. Empirical studies will probably lead to rearrangement of the present division, this should be looked into in connection with the morphological disambiguator (cg grammar).</p>

        <section id="Adpositions" >
          <title>Adpositions</title>
          <p>Adpositions are are <em>bajil, birra, gaskal</em>, etc. These are in the pp-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +Adp and their lexicon path is:</p>
          <p>Root -> Adposition -> Pp -> #</p>

      <title>Abbreviations</title>
      <p>There is a file called abbr-sme-lex.txt. Work on abbreviations has not yet begun, the file contains just some dummy entries.</p>
