    <section>
      <title>File structure</title>

      <p>The file format is documented in the Xerox manuals, especially in <a
      href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/fssoft/docs/lexc-93/lexc93.html">Karttunen
      1993 Finite-State Lexicon Compiler</a>, but see also the <a
      href="http://www.fsmbook.com">Beesley and Karttunen book</a>. The file
      itself consists of a section defining Multichar_symbols, and of a large
      number of lexica, 183 lexica according to the present count (19.10.01).
      The file sme-lex.txt contains a.o. the continuation lexica for nouns,
      verbs and adjectives, whereas the bulk of the lexicon is divided into
      different files, as indicated below.</p>

      <p>In the sme-lex.txt file, the <strong>Multichar_Symbols</strong>
      section contains all grammatical tags, and all multicharacter members of
      the alphabet (the latter set is taken from the grammar file).</p>

      <p>The <strong>Root</strong> lexicon points to the lexica of the
      different parts of speech: (for each sublexicon there is a pointer to
      the relevant file containing the sublexicon)</p>

    <section>
      <title>Nouns</title>

      <section>
        <title>The NounRoot lexicon</title>

        <section>
          <title>The structure of the noun-sme.txt file</title>

          <p>The file contains the following sections:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>LEXICON GuessNoun</li>

            <li>LEXICON NounRoot<ol>
                <li>Stray forms</li>

                <li>Compounds</li>

                <li>Multiword nouns</li>

                <li>The noun stems themselves, sorted a tergo</li>
              </ol></li>
          </ol>

          <p>The GuessNoun lexiconbelongs to the guess-sme binary file. The
          idea behind this is to have a binary file that guesses the
          grammatical form of nouns on the basis of their suffix, a
          hypothetical form like <em>plineraiguin</em> could for example be
          hypothetised to be the Comitative Plural of <em>plinera</em>. The
          guesser has not been used, and it is unclear whether it works at
          all. TODO: Check this.</p>

          <p>The lexicon NounRoot first has some temporary sections. There is
          a set "compounds, awaiting a solution on the shorting question",
          such like sámegiel, oar, beal, etc., reduced first- and middlepart
          compounds. The long-term solution is to build a syllable shortener
          for these compounds, for the time being the lexicalised ones are
          listed here. This section also contain some loanwords that typically
          have a shorter, non-sámi form as compounds, and a longer, Sámi form
          when used as independent word. An illustrative example is the word
          <em>sosial</em>. In isolation, we find sosiála, but as compound, we
          find <em>sosialdepartemeantta</em>, etc. Thus, these words are
          listed here, pointing directly to the compound lexicon R.</p>

          <p>The section "Multiword nouns" contains one multiword noun, and
          some stray affixes. These do not work. TODO: Fix this section,
          probably by removing the entries.</p>

          <p>Finally, the noun stem section itself is the large one, it
          contains almost 19000 nouns, they are divided into different noun
          stem classes. They are documented in the next section.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>The noun stem classes</title>

          <p>In the documentation, have a special look at these pair
          lexica:</p>

          GAHPIR, GISTTA, GOAHTI, JOHTOLAT, MALIS, SEAMU, STAHTA, VIVVA. The
          lexica represent the following inflectional types:</p>

        <title>The file structure</title>

        <p><strong>Propernoun</strong> is one file, with the inflectional
        lexica first, followed by the 35000 items long proper noun lexicon.
        This lexicon points to sveral sublexica. They are shown below, ordered
        according to the phonological and semaintcal properties of the stem.
        The mark "??" in the Lexicon column indicates that no lexicon has been
        assigned to this type, i.e., that the lexicon ACCRA has not been split
        the same way that CNAME has.</p>

        <p>TBW: Commenting and completing the above table.</p>

        <p>Note that the lexica <code>ACCRA, CNAME</code> are temporary
        lexica, meant for names that still have not had their xemantics fixed.
        Thus, we need one lexicon for <em>Place</em>, one for <em>Person</em>,
        and one for <em>Place/Person</em>. We need a policy for proper names,
        e.g. inspired by the lexicon for Finnish at the University of
        Helsinki.</p>

        <p>In our lexicon, the <em>-nen</em> names are marked as person names.
        In most cases, this is indeed the case, but some -nen names are place
        names as well as person names (e.g. <em>Pielinen</em>). In Sámi text,
        most -nen names are probably still person names, and they are here all
        treated as person names.</p>

        <section>
          <title>Sámi geographical names</title>

          <p>Sámi names have been added from Norway, in 2002. Since that,
          Statens Kartverk has translated most (all?) Sámi names from the old
          Bergsland/Ruong to the new 1979 orthography. Now, the remaining Sámi
          names should be added to the list, in the following way:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>All North Sámi names should be extracted from the map base and
            run against the transducer</li>

            <li>The names that do not get a +Prop tag should be extracted, and
            then added to the base.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Sámi names from Finland and Sweden have not beeen added, but they
          are underway.</p>

          <p>Sámi names from outside Sápmi, as listed in <em>Sámi Atlas</em>
          are added. Other Sámi names from outside Sápmi should also be added,
          but we don't know of good sources for such names (language councils
          are one possibility)</p>

          <p>Names in other Sámi languages are increasingly being used in
          North Sámi texts, e.g. when referring to South Sámi or Lule Sámi
          institutions. These ones should be added and organised in
          lexica.</p>

          <title>Comments to the verb sublexica</title>

          <p>Within each of the main groups, there are FOUR types, impersonal
          verbs, verbs with and without personal passives, and verbs without
          Personal Passive but with Acc obj (+ two more lexicas, see above The
          VerbRoot lexicon). The difference between <em>i/a/u</em> and
          <em>e/á/o</em> verbs is handeled in the rules file, and not in the
          lexicon file.</p>

          <p>The with / without Personal Passive distinction shows up in one
          sublexicon. DOHPPE has PASSIVE, where GILLE has SG3PASS. So, this is
          (probably) a transivity difference, cf. also <em>diehtit</em> vs.
          <em>boahtit</em>. It seems thus that the difference is one of
          transitivity: 0, 1 and 2 valence.</p>

          <p>At present, the file <em>verb-sme-lex.txt</em> comtains all the
          verbs. In the beginning of the file, all sublexica are exemplified.
          Then follows the bulk of the verbs, twosyllabic even, manysyllabic
          even, odd and contracted verbs.</p>

        to appropriate Px sublexica. These sublexica are the same as the ones
        for nouns, they are found in the sme-lex.txt file. The only exception
        are some sublexica that are used only for plural forms, these are
        duplicated here from the sme-lex file, in order not to revise the main

        <p>The section on reciprocal pronouns consists of three parts. The

        handle the 2nd part of the non-Px recipr. Finally, the members of the
        third section point to special Px sublexica, designed for the
        reciprocal pronouns, and found in the same section.</p>

        <title>Relative pronouns</title>

        <p>Formally, the relative and interrogative pronouns are identical. In

        instead we use the interrogative pronouns.</p>

      <section>
        <title>Indefinite pronouns</title>

        <p>We divide the indefinite pronouns into three groups, with a fourth
        group of leftovers waiting for a better destiny:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Declineable indefinite pronouns with case + clitic
          (<em>mihkkege, giige, guhtemušge</em>)</li>

          <li>Declineable indefinites with normal case paradigms (<em>eará,
          eanas, muhtin</em>)</li>

          <li>Indeclineable indefinites (<em>buot, eatnat, guhtet</em>)</li>

          <li>TODO: A set of ideosyncratic cases</li>
        </ol>

        <section>
          <title>Declineable indefinite pronouns with case + clitic</title>

          <p>These pronouns have two stems, one nominative, and one oblique,
          and the clitic <em>-ge</em> attached to the case ending. The initial
          lexicon splits them in two, one hard-coded nominative (e.g.
          <em>giige</em>), and one oblique stem (e.g. <em>gea-</em>). Then,
          the case + clitic sequence is treated as a single suffix (e.g.
          locative <em>-sge</em>, etc.). Since the clitic slot has already
          been filled, they are directed to <code>#</code> rather than to
          <code>K</code>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Declineable indefinites with normal case paradigms</title>

          <p>This section hosts a seemingly complicated system of taylored
          sublexica. It contains three sections: First a section where the
          pronouns themselved are split into different continuation lexica,
          then a section with intoermadiate lexica, and finally a section with
          the case suffixes themselves. The lexica are partly modelled upon
          nominal lexica.</p>

          <p>Naming convention for the sublexica:</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>-c, -v</dt>

            <dd>Consonant stem, vowel stem</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
            <dt>-n, -ne</dt>

            <dd>nominative, nominative and essive</dd>
          </dl>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Indeclineable indefinites</title>

          <p>There is first a list of multiword indefinites. These are picked
          out by the preprocessor and copied onto a file abbr.txt and put in
          the bin/ catalogue. In thie closed-sme-lex.txt they behave like the
          other indeclineable indefinites.</p>

          <p></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>The ideosyncratic rest category</title>

          <p>Indefinite pronouns are complex, and the grammars are not always
          explicit enough, so this section hosts a set of pronouns, partly
          with a hard-coded tag, partly just commented out. They are awaiting
          a principled linguistic solution, but in order to do that, we need
          more info than we can get from the reference grammars.</p>

          <p>TODO: Have a linguistic/native speaker-look at this section.</p>
        </section>

    <section>
      <title>Numerals</title>

      <section>
        <title>Overview of the lexicon structure</title>

        <p>The numeral lexica are formed as a generator, generating all
        possible numerals. The basic lexicon is <code>Numeral</code>, and it
        looks like this:</p>

        <p></p>

        <source>
LEXICON Numeral
MILJON ; ! a noun of its own
UNDERDUHAT ; ! for generator under 1000
JUSTDUHAT ; ! going via 1000
OVERDUHAT ; ! for generator over 1000
OLD ; ! for "thirteen hundred, etc.
!num-basic ; ! replaced by the 5 lexica above
!num-derived ; ! still unimplemented
num-imprecise ;! still almost unimplemented
ARABIC ; ! for the arabic numerals
ROMAN ; ! for the roman numerals
</source>

        <p>MILJON is a noun. OLD is the old way of counting. num-ordinal act
        like adjectives, they are not finished yet. ARABIC and ROMAN contain
        number generators.</p>

        <p>So, what is the reason for the three different lexica around
        1000?</p>

        <p>The reason is that the numeric system turns at the thousand mark.
        Numbers above it and numbers below it behave in the same way, thus we
        have both <em>twentyfour</em> and <em>twentyfourthousand</em>,
        etc.</p>

        <p>The path is OVERDUHAT -&gt; JUSTDUHAT -&gt; UNDERDUHAT. OVERDUHAT
        generates the part of the numeral that is over 1000, and all these
        lexica then point to JUSTDUHAT. That lexicon has an optional "(one)
        thousand" before it leads either to DUHAT and via the relevant case
        paradigm to K, or to UNDERDUHAT. UNDERDUHAT contains the numerals
        1-999. UNDERDUHAT starts with the lexicon for one, and gives each
        group of numerals its own lexicon.</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Case inflection of numerals</title>

        <p>At the moment, the numerals only case inflected for the last part.
        This is partly due to technical difficulties, and partly due to the
        poor documentation of the system.</p>

        <p>TODO: Get a better linguistic description of the numerals, then
        have a close look at how this is done for e.g. Finnish, and then
        implement it as it should be done.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Cardinals and ordinals</title>

        <p>The cardinal and ordinal numbers are split at the final lexica, the
        <code>OKTAF</code> and <code>2TO9F</code> lexica. This generates both
        numbers as second and fiftysecond, but not numbers such as
        fiftysecondthousand. To the extent that such numbers exists, the issue
        should be looked into.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Indeclinable words</title>

      <p>All the lexica for indeclinable words are made the same way:</p>

      <p></p>

      <source>
LEXICON Root
Adverb ;
 LEXICON Adverb
 a1d1amusat adv ;
  LEXICON adv
  +Adv:0 K ;
</source>

      <p>The Root lexicon points to the POS lexica (Adverb etc.). Each of the
      POS lexica lists the entries, with a pointer to an arbitrarily named
      sublexicon (here "adv"). This sublexicon contains the grammatical tag
      for the POS in question (the tag has no surface form, hence ":0"), and
      eventually a pointer towards the cliticon lexicon K. Adverbs can have
      clitics added, hence K, whereas subjunctions do not, hence no K.</p>

      <p>[XXX At the moment particles are not directed to K, perhaps they
      should be. TODO: Check with corpus and native speakers.]</p>

      <section>
        <title>Adverbs</title>

        <p>They are explained in the intro to the section "Indeclinable words"
        above.</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Particles</title>

        <p>These are in the closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +Pcle and
        th|qeir lexicon path is:</p>

        <p>Root -&gt; Particle -&gt; pcle -&gt; #</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Subjunctions</title>

        <p>Subjunctions are <em>ahte, juos</em>, etc. These are in the
        closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their lexicon path is:</p>

        <p>Root -&gt; Subjunction -&gt; -&gt; #</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Conjunctions</title>

        <p>Conjunctions are <em>ja, dahjege</em>, etc. These are in the
        closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +CC and their lexicon path
        is:</p>

        <p>Root -&gt; Conjunction -&gt; Cc -&gt; #</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>P-positions</title>

        <p>There are three different classes here: Postpositions, occuring
        after their complement, prepositions, occuring before, and
        adpositions, occuring both before and after. This could have been done
        the Lingsoft way as well: Having +Adp as a common tag for both, and
        eventually +Prep and +Postp as subtags, no subtag would indicate both
        ways (or both subtags could be used). At the moment, they are left as
        3 distinct groups. The classification is based upon Nickel,
        p-positions found only in Sammallahti's dictionary and not in Nickel
        were put in the Adposition group. Empirical studies will probably lead
        to rearrangement of the present division, this should be looked into
        in connection with the morphological disambiguator (cg grammar).</p>
