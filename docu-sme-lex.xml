    <section>
      <title>File structure</title>

      <p>The file format is documented in the Xerox manuals, especially in <a
      href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/fssoft/docs/lexc-93/lexc93.html">Karttunen
      1993 Finite-State Lexicon Compiler</a>, but see also the <a
      href="http://www.fsmbook.com">Beesley and Karttunen book</a>. The file
      itself consists of a section defining
      <strong>Multichar_symbols</strong>, and of a large number of lexica, 183
      lexica according to the present count (19.10.01). The file sme-lex.txt
      contains a.o. the continuation lexica for nouns, verbs and adjectives,
      whereas the bulk of the lexicon is divided into different files, as
      indicated below.</p>

      <p>In the sme-lex.txt file, the <strong>Multichar_Symbols</strong>
      section contains all grammatical tags, and all multicharacter members of
      the alphabet (the latter set is taken from the grammar file).</p>

      <p>The <strong>Root</strong> lexicon points to the lexica of the
      different parts of speech: (for each sublexicon there is a pointer to
      the relevant file containing the sublexicon)</p>

      <section>
        <title>The NounRoot lexicon</title>

        <section>
          <title>The structure of the noun-sme.txt file</title>

          <p>The file contains the following sections:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>LEXICON GuessNoun</li>

            <li>LEXICON NounRoot<ol>
                <li>Stray forms</li>

                <li>Compounds</li>

                <li>Multiword nouns</li>

                <li>The noun stems themselves, sorted alphabetically (the
                alphabetical sorting is according to the computer algorithm,
                and not according to the Saami one)</li>
              </ol></li>
          </ol>

          <p>The GuessNoun lexiconbelongs to the guess-sme binary file. The
          idea behind this is to have a binary file that guesses the
          grammatical form of nouns on the basis of their suffix, a
          hypothetical form like <em>plineraiguin</em> could for example be
          hypothetised to be the Comitative Plural of <em>plinera</em>. The
          guesser has not been used, and it is unclear whether it works at
          all. TODO: Check this.</p>

          <p>The lexicon NounRoot first has some temporary sections. There is
          a set "compounds, awaiting a solution on the shorting question",
          such like sámegiel, oar, beal, etc., reduced first- and middlepart
          compounds. The long-term solution is to build a syllable shortener
          for these compounds, for the time being the lexicalised ones are
          listed here. This section also contain some loanwords that typically
          have a shorter, non-sámi form as compounds, and a longer, Saami form
          when used as independent word. An illustrative example is the word
          <em>sosial</em>. In isolation, we find sosiála, but as compound, we
          find <em>sosialdepartemeantta</em>, etc. Thus, these words are
          listed here, pointing directly to the compound lexicon R.</p>

          <p>Finally, the noun stem section itself is the large one, it
          contains about 26500 nouns, they are divided into different noun
          stem classes. They are documented in the next section.</p>

        <p><strong>Propernoun</strong> is one file, with the inflectional
        lexica first, followed by the over 36000 items long proper noun
        lexicon. This lexicon points to several sublexica. They are shown
        below, ordered according to the phonological and semantical properties
        of the stem. After the table comes a list of lexica not yet integrated
        in the table.</p>

          <title>Saami geographical names</title>

          <p>Saami names have been added from Norway, in 2002. Since that,
          Statens Kartverk has translated most (all?) Saami names from the old
          Bergsland/Ruong to the new 1979 orthography. Now, the remaining Sámi
          names should be added to the list, in the following way:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>All North Saami names should be extracted from the map base and
            run against the transducer</li>

            <li>The names that do not get a +Prop tag should be extracted, and
            then added to the base.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Saami names from Finland and Sweden have not been added, but they
          are underway.</p>

          <p>Saami names from outside Sápmi, as listed in <em>Sámi Atlas</em>
          are added. Other Saami names from outside Sápmi should also be added,
          but we don't know of good sources for such names (language councils
          are one possibility)</p>

          <p>Names in other Saami languages are increasingly being used in
          North Saami texts, e.g. when referring to South Saami or Lule Saami
          institutions. These ones should be added and organised in
          lexica.</p>

          <title>Comments to the verb sublexica</title>

          <p>Within each of the main groups, there are FIVE types, impersonal
          verbs, verbs with and without personal passives, verbs without
          Personal Passive but with Acc obj (+ two more lexicas, see above The
          VerbRoot lexicon), and inherent passives. The difference between
          <em>i/a/u</em> and <em>e/á/o</em> verbs is handeled in the rules
          file, and not in the lexicon file.</p>

          <p>The with / without Personal Passive distinction shows up in one
          sublexicon. DOHPPE has PASSIVE, where GILLE has SG3PASS. So, this is
          (probably) a transivity difference, cf. also <em>diehtit</em> vs.
          <em>boahtit</em>. It seems thus that the difference is one of
          transitivity: 0, 1 and 2 valence.</p>

          <p>At present, the file <em>verb-sme-lex.txt</em> comtains all the
          verbs. In the beginning of the file, all sublexica are exemplified.
          Then follows the bulk of the verbs, twosyllabic even, manysyllabic
          even, odd and contracted verbs.</p>

        <p>The Nominative forms are just listed. The oblique ones are directed
        to the sublexicon reflobl, and there directed via different case stems
        to appropriate Px sublexica. These sublexica are the same as the ones
        for nouns, they are found in the sme-lex.txt file. The only exception
        are some sublexica that are used only for plural forms, these are
        duplicated here from the sme-lex file, in order not to revise the main

        handle the 2nd part of the non-Px recipr. Finally, the members of the

          <title>Declineable indefinite pronouns with case + clitic</title>

          <p>These pronouns have two stems, one nominative, and one oblique,
          and the clitic <em>-ge</em> attached to the case ending. The initial
          lexicon splits them in two, one hard-coded nominative (e.g.
          <em>giige</em>), and one oblique stem (e.g. <em>gea-</em>). Then,
          the case + clitic sequence is treated as a single suffix (e.g.
          locative <em>-sge</em>, etc.). Since the clitic slot has already
          been filled, they are directed to <code>#</code> rather than to
          <code>K</code>.</p>

          <title>Declineable indefinites with normal case paradigms</title>

          <p>This section hosts a seemingly complicated system of taylored
          sublexica. It contains three sections: First a section where the
          pronouns themselved are split into different continuation lexica,
          then a section with intoermadiate lexica, and finally a section with
          the case suffixes themselves. The lexica are partly modelled upon
          nominal lexica.</p>

          <p>Naming convention for the sublexica:</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>-c, -v</dt>

            <dd>Consonant stem, vowel stem</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
            <dt>-n, -ne</dt>

            <dd>nominative, nominative and essive</dd>
          </dl>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Indeclineable indefinites</title>

          <p>There is first a list of multiword indefinites. These are picked
          out by the preprocessor and copied onto a file abbr.txt and put in
          the bin/ catalogue. In thie closed-sme-lex.txt they behave like the
          other indeclineable indefinites.</p>

        <section>
          <title>The ideosyncratic rest category</title>

          <p>Indefinite pronouns are complex, and the grammars are not always
          explicit enough, so this section hosts a set of pronouns, partly
          with a hard-coded tag, partly just commented out. They are awaiting
          a principled linguistic solution, but in order to do that, we need
          more info than we can get from the reference grammars.</p>

          <p>TODO: Have a linguistic/native speaker-look at this section.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Numerals</title>

      <section>
        <title>Overview of the lexicon structure</title>

        <p>The numeral lexica are formed as a generator, generating all
        possible numerals. The basic lexicon is <code>Numeral</code>, and it
        looks like this:</p>

        <p></p>

        <source>
LEXICON Numeral
MILJON ; ! a noun of its own
UNDERDUHAT ; ! for generator under 1000
JUSTDUHAT ; ! going via 1000
OVERDUHAT ; ! for generator over 1000
OLD ; ! for "thirteen hundred, etc.
!num-basic ; ! replaced by the 5 lexica above
!num-derived ; ! still unimplemented
num-imprecise ;! still almost unimplemented
ARABIC ; ! for the arabic numerals
ROMAN ; ! for the roman numerals
</source>

        <p>MILJON is a noun. OLD is the old way of counting. num-ordinal act
        like adjectives, they are not finished yet. ARABIC and ROMAN contain
        number generators.</p>

        <p>So, what is the reason for the three different lexica around
        1000?</p>

        <p>The reason is that the numeric system turns at the thousand mark.
        Numbers above it and numbers below it behave in the same way, thus we
        have both <em>twentyfour</em> and <em>twentyfourthousand</em>,
        etc.</p>

        <p>The path is OVERDUHAT -&gt; JUSTDUHAT -&gt; UNDERDUHAT. OVERDUHAT
        generates the part of the numeral that is over 1000, and all these
        lexica then point to JUSTDUHAT. That lexicon has an optional "(one)
        thousand" before it leads either to DUHAT and via the relevant case
        paradigm to K, or to UNDERDUHAT. UNDERDUHAT contains the numerals
        1-999. UNDERDUHAT starts with the lexicon for one, and gives each
        group of numerals its own lexicon.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Cardinals and ordinals</title>

        <p>The cardinal and ordinal numbers are split at the final lexica, the
        <code>OKTAF</code> and <code>2TO9F</code> lexica. This generates both
        numbers as second and fiftysecond.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Indeclinable words</title>

      <p>All the lexica for indeclinable words are made the same way:</p>

      <p></p>

      <source>
LEXICON Root
Adverb ;
 LEXICON Adverb
 áđamusat adv ;
  LEXICON adv
  +Adv:0 K ;
</source>

      <p>The Root lexicon points to the POS lexica (Adverb etc.). Each of the
      POS lexica lists the entries, with a pointer to an arbitrarily named
      sublexicon (here "adv"). This sublexicon contains the grammatical tag
      for the POS in question (the tag has no surface form, hence ":0"), and
      eventually a pointer towards the cliticon lexicon K. Adverbs can have
      clitics added, hence K, whereas subjunctions do not, hence no K.</p>

      <p>[XXX At the moment particles are not directed to K, perhaps they
      should be. TODO: Check with corpus and native speakers.]</p>

      <section>
        <title>Adverbs</title>

        <p>They are explained in the intro to the section "Indeclinable words"
        above.</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Particles</title>

        <p>These are in the closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +Pcle and
        th|qeir lexicon path is:</p>

        <p>Root -&gt; Particle -&gt; pcle -&gt; #</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Subjunctions</title>

        <p>Subjunctions are <em>ahte, juos</em>, etc. These are in the
        closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their lexicon path is:</p>

        <p>Root -&gt; Subjunction -&gt; -&gt; #</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Conjunctions</title>

        <p>Conjunctions are <em>ja, dahjege</em>, etc. These are in the
        closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +CC and their lexicon path
        is:</p>

        <p>Root -&gt; Conjunction -&gt; Cc -&gt; #</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>P-positions</title>

        <p>There are three different classes here: Postpositions, occuring
        after their complement, prepositions, occuring before, and
        adpositions, occuring both before and after. This could have been done
        the Lingsoft way as well: Having +Adp as a common tag for both, and
        eventually +Prep and +Postp as subtags, no subtag would indicate both
        ways (or both subtags could be used). At the moment, they are left as
        3 distinct groups. The classification is based upon Nickel,
        p-positions found only in Sammallahti's dictionary and not in Nickel
        were put in the Adposition group. Empirical studies will probably lead
        to rearrangement of the present division, this should be looked into
        in connection with the morphological disambiguator (cg grammar).</p>

        <p></p>

        <section>
          <title>Adpositions</title>

          <p>Adpositions are are <em>bajil, birra, gaskal</em>, etc. These are

          is:</p>

          <p>Root -&gt; Adposition -&gt; Pp -&gt; #</p>
