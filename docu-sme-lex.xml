      <title>File structure</title>

      <p>The file format is documented in the Xerox manuals, especially in
      <link
      href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/research/mltt/fssoft/docs/lexc-93/lexc93.html">Karttunen
      1993 Finite-State Lexicon Compiler</link>, but see also the forthcoming
      Beesley and Karttunen book. The file consists of a section defining
      Multichar_symbols, and of a large number of lexica, 183 lexica according
      to the present count (19.10.01). The file sme-lex.txt contains a.o. the
      continuation lexica for nouns, verbs and adjectives, whereas the bulk of
      the lexicon is divided into different files, as indicated below.</p>

      <p>In the sme-lex.txt file, the <strong>Multichar_Symbols</strong>
      section contains all grammatical tags, and all multicharacter members of
      the alphabet (the latter set is taken from the grammar file).</p>

      <p>The <strong>Root</strong> lexicon points to the lexica of the
      different parts of speech: (for each sublexicon there is a pointer to
      the relevant file containing the sublexicon)</p>

      <section>
        <title>The NounRoot lexicon</title>

        <p>NOTE. The additional noun lexicon <em>subst-s-7b</em> differs not
        too much from the lexicon already added to the save file. It should
        not be added yet.</p>

        <p><strong>NounRoot</strong> has the lexica BOAZU, FALIS, GADDI,
        GAHPIR, GISTTA, GOAHTI, JOHTOLAT, MALIS, SEAMU, STAHTA, VIVVA. The
        lexica represent the following inflectional types:</p>

        <p>The sublexica, alphabetically ordered</p>

<p>
<br />BEANA = trisyllabic animated gradating 0-nouns
<br />BOAZU = animate contracted 0-nouns
<br />FALIS = contracted animate C-nouns.
<br />GADDI = bisyllabic V-nouns with comparative forms
<br />GAHPIR = trisyllabic, non-gradating C-nouns.
<br />GISTTA =
<br />GOAHTI = inanimate bisyllabic V-nouns.
<br />IIJA = bisyllabic, non-gradating a-nouns, wit an a-illative.

<br />SEAMU =
<br />SUOLU = inanimate contracted 0-nouns.
<br />STAHTA = bisyllabic, non-gradating a-nouns, with an a/i-illative.
<br />VIVVA = animate bilsyllabic V-nouns.

<p>
<br />VIVVA = bilsyllabic animate V-nouns
<br />GOAHTI = bisyllabic inanimate V-nouns

<br />IIJA = bisyllabic, non-gradating a-nouns, with an a-illative
<br />STAHTA = bisyllabic, non-gradating a-nouns, with an a/i-illative

      <title>The ProperNoun lexicon</title>

      <p>The proper nouns are stored in <code>gt/sme/src/propernoun-sme-lex.txt</code>.</p>

      <section>
        <title>The file structure</title>

        <p><strong>Propernoun</strong> is divided into two sublexica,
        SamiProperNoun and GeneralProperNoun (this division is for clarity
        reasons, and can be dispensed with as soon as the structure of all the
        names is clear.). here are the lexica:</p>


<source>
ACCRA = foreign names ending in a stressless vowel.
NYSTØ = foreign names ending in a stressed vowel.
CNAME = foreign names ending in a consonant
C-FI-NEN = Finnish names of the "Itkonen" type, with Gen = Itkosa / Itkonena
LONDON ! Final foot structure (X.) and (X..) => Loc:is
BERN ! Final foot structure (X) => Loc:as
</source>


        <p>These are the lexica for Sáami names:</p>

        <p>NIILLAS = trisyllabic, non-gradating C-proper names.</p>

        <p>PIERA = bisyllabic a-proper names without gradation;
        a/i-illative.</p>

        <p>HEANDARAT</p>

        <p>MARJA = bisyllabic vowel-final names with gradation</p>

          <section>
            <title>Comments to the verb sublexica</title>

            <p>Within each of the main groups, there are three types,
            impersonal verbs and verbs with and without personal passives. The
            difference between <em>i/a/u</em> and <em>e/á/o</em> verbs is
            handeled in the rules file, and not in the lexicon file.</p>

            <p>The with / without Personal Passive distinction shows up in one
            sublexicon. DOHPPE has PASSIVE, where GILLE has SG3PASS. So, this
            is (probably) a transivity difference, cf. also <em>diehtit</em>
            vs. <em>boahtit</em>. It seems thus that the difference is one of
            transitivity: 0, 1 and 2 valence.</p>

            <p>At present, the file <em>verb-sme-lex.txt</em> comtains all the
            verbs. In the beginning of the file, all sublexica are
            exemplified. Then follows the bulk of the verbs, twosyllabic even,
            manysyllabic even, odd and contracted verbs. These verbs are all
            given the sublexica DIEHTI, MUITAL and DOHPPE, i.e., they are
            given the transitive sublexicon, the maximal paradigm.</p>

            <p>TODO: Assign corrct transitivity/sublexicon marking to the bulk
            of the verbs. Also, the undefined sublexica should be
            investigated.</p>

            <p>Pekka gives them the following comment to the dec 01 files:</p>

            <p>Tiedosto sisältää verbiartikkelien hakusanat. Joissakin
            tapauksissa on myös vaihtoehtoja (x ~ y) ja variantin kohdalla on
            viite päähakusanaan (x gc1. y). Pituusviivalliset vokaalimerkit on
            korvattu x2-yhdistelmillä, pisteelliset x3-yhdistelmillä.
            Kolmannen kestoasteen merkkinä on ', jonka koodi DOS:ssa on 173.
            Joidenkin hakusanojen yhteydessä on suluissa tietoa rektiosta,
            esim. liikot (+ lok.); tämä tieto ei ole toistaiseksi
            systemaattista.</p>

        to the sublexicon reflobl, and there directed via different case stems
        to appropriate Px sublexica. These sublexica are the same as the ones
        for nouns, they are found in the sme-lex.txt file. The only exception
        are some sublexica that are used only for plural forms, these are
        duplicated here from the sme-lex file, in order not to revise the main
        lexicon.</p>

        <section>
          <title>Overview of the lexicon structure</title>

          <p>The numeral lexica are formed as a generator, generating all
          possible numerals. The basic lexicon is Numeral, and it looks like
          this:</p>

          <p></p>

<source>
LEXICON Numeral
MILJON ; ! a noun of its own
UNDERDUHAT ; ! for generator under 1000
JUSTDUHAT ; ! going via 1000
OVERDUHAT ; ! for generator over 1000
OLD ; ! for "thirteen hundred, etc.
!num-basic ; ! replaced by the 5 lexica above
num-ordinal ; ! The basic ordinal numbers
!num-derived ; ! still unimplemented
num-imprecise ;! still almost unimplemented
ARABIC ; ! for the arabic numerals
ROMAN ; ! for the roman numerals
</source>
          <p>MILJON is a noun. OLD is the old way of counting. num-ordinal act
          like adjectives, they are not finished yet. ARABIC and ROMAN contain
          number generators.</p>

          <p>So, what is the reasin for the three different lexica around
          1000?</p>

          <p>The path is OVERDUHAT -&gt; JUSTDUHAT -&gt; UNDERDUHAT. OVERDUHAT
          generates the part of the numeral that is over 1000, and all these
          lexica then point to JUSTDUHAT. That lexicon has an optional "(one)
          thousand" before it leads either to DUHAT and via the relevant case
          paradigm to K, or to UNDERDUHAT. UNDERDUHAT contains the numerals
          1-999. UNDERDUHAT starts with the lexicon for one, and gives each
          group of numerals its own lexicon.</p>

      <title>Indeclinable words</title>

      <p>All the lexica for indeclinable words are made the same way:</p>

      <p></p>


<source>
LEXICON Root
Adverb ;
 LEXICON Adverb
 a1d1amusat adv ;
  LEXICON adv
  +Adv:0 K ;
</source>

      <p>The Root lexicon points to the POS lexica (Adverb etc.). Each of the
      POS lexica lists the entries, with a pointer to an arbitrarily named
      sublexicon (here "adv"). This sublexicon contains the grammatical tag
      for the POS in question (the tag has no surface form, hence ":0"), and
      eventually a pointer towards the cliticon lexicon K. Adverbs can have
      clitics added, hence K, whereas subjunctions do not, hence no K. [XXX At
      the moment particles are not directed to K, perhaps they should be.]</p>

      <section>
        <title>Adverbs</title>

        <p>They are explained in the intro above.</p>

      <section>
        <title>Particles</title>

        <p>These are in the closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +Pcle and
        th|qeir lexicon path is:</p>

        <p>Root -&gt; Particle -&gt; pcle -&gt; #</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Subjunctions</title>

        <p>Subjunctions are <em>ahte, juos</em>, etc. These are in the
        closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their lexicon path is:</p>

        <p>Root -&gt; Subjunction -&gt; -&gt; #</p>

      <section>
        <title>Conjunctions</title>

        <p>Conjunctions are <em>ja, dahjege</em>, etc. These are in the
        closed-sme-lex.txt file. Their tag is +CC and their lexicon path
        is:</p>

      <section>
        <title>P-positions</title>

        <p>There are three different classes here: Postpositions, occuring
        after their complement, prepositions, occuring before, and
        adpositions, occuring both before and after. This could have been done
        the Lingsoft way as well: Having +Adp as a common tag for both, and
        eventually +Prep and +Postp as subtags, no subtag would indicate both
        ways (or both subtags could be used). At the moment, they are left as
        3 distinct groups. The classification is based upon Nickel,
        p-positions found only in Sammallahti's dictionary and not in Nickel
        were put in the Adposition group. Empirical studies will probably lead
        to rearrangement of the present division, this should be looked into
        in connection with the morphological disambiguator (cg grammar).</p>
